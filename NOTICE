"ansi@0.3.0","https://github.com/TooTallNate/ansi.js","MIT*","ansi.js ========= ### Advanced ANSI formatting tool for Node.js  `ansi.js` is a module for Node.js that provides an easy-to-use API for writing ANSI escape codes to `Stream` instances. ANSI escape codes are used to do fancy things in a terminal window, like render text in colors, delete characters, lines, the entire window, or hide and show the cursor, and lots more!  #### Features:   * 256 color support for the terminal!  * Make a beep sound from your terminal!  * Works with *any* writable `Stream` instance.  * Allows you to move the cursor anywhere on the terminal window.  * Allows you to delete existing contents from the terminal window.  * Allows you to hide and show the cursor.  * Converts CSS color codes and RGB values into ANSI escape codes.  * Low-level; you are in control of when escape codes are used, it's not abstracted.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install ansi ```   Example -------  ``` js var ansi = require('ansi')   , cursor = ansi(process.stdout)  // You can chain your calls forever: cursor   .red()                 // Set font color to red   .bg.grey()             // Set background color to grey   .write('Hello World!') // Write 'Hello World!' to stdout   .bg.reset()            // Reset the bgcolor before writing the trailing \n,                          //      to avoid Terminal glitches   .write('\n')           // And a final \n to wrap things up  // Rendering modes are persistent: cursor.hex('#660000').bold().underline()  // You can use the regular logging functions, text will be green: console.log('This is blood red, bold text')  // To reset just the foreground color: cursor.fg.reset()  console.log('This will still be bold')  // to go to a location (x,y) on the console // note: 1-indexed, not 0-indexed: cursor.goto(10, 5).write('Five down, ten over')  // to clear the current line: cursor.horizontalAbsolute(0).eraseLine().write('Starting again')  // to go to a different column on the current line: cursor.horizontalAbsolute(5).write('column five')  // Clean up after yourself! cursor.reset() ```   License -------  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2012 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"array-index@0.1.1","https://github.com/TooTallNate/array-index","MIT*","array-index =========== ### Invoke getter/setter functions on array-like objects [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/array-index.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/array-index)   This little module provides an `ArrayIndex` constructor function that you can inherit from with your own objects. When a numbered property gets read, then the `__get__` function on the object will be invoked. When a numbered property gets set, then the `__set__` function on the object will be invoked.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install array-index ```   Examples --------  A quick silly example, using `Math.sqrt()` for the 'getter':  ``` js var ArrayIndex = require('array-index')  // let's just create a singleton instance. var a = new ArrayIndex()  // the '__get__' function is invoked for each 'a[n]' access. // it is given a single argument, the 'index' currently being accessed. // so here, we're passing in the `Math.sqrt()` function, so accessing // 'a[9]' will return `Math.sqrt(9)`. a.__get__ = Math.sqrt  // the '__get__' and '__set__' functions are only invoked up // to 'a.length', so we must set that manually. a.length = 10  console.log(a) // [ 0, //   1, //   1.4142135623730951, //   1.7320508075688772, //   2, //   2.23606797749979, //   2.449489742783178, //   2.6457513110645907, //   2.8284271247461903, //   3, //   __get__: [Function: sqrt] ] ```  Here's an example of creating a subclass of `ArrayIndex` using `util.inherits()`:  ``` js var ArrayIndex = require('array-index') var inherits = require('util').inherits  function MyArray (length) {   // be sure to call the ArrayIndex constructor in your own constructor   ArrayIndex.call(this, length)    // the 'set' object will contain values at indexes previously set,   // so that they can be returned in the 'getter' function. This is just a   // silly example, your subclass will have more meaningful logic.   Object.defineProperty(this, 'set', {     value: Object.create(null),     enumerable: false   }) }  // inherit from the ArrayIndex's prototype inherits(MyArray, ArrayIndex)  MyArray.prototype.__get__ = function (index) {   if (index in this.set) return this.set[index]   return index * 2 }  MyArray.prototype.__set__ = function (index, v) {   this.set[index] = v }   // and now you can create some instances var a = new MyArray(15) a[9] = a[10] = a[14] = '_' a[0] = 'nate'  console.log(a) // [ 'nate', 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, '_', '_', 22, 24, 26, '_' ] ```  API ---  The `ArrayIndex` base class is meant to be subclassed, but it also has a few convenient functions built-in.  ### 'length' -> Number  The length of the ArrayIndex instance. The `__get__` and `__set__` functions will only be invoked on the object up to this 'length'. You may set this length at any time to adjust the amount range where the getters/setters will be invoked.  ### 'toArray()' -> Array  Returns a new regular Array instance with the same values that this ArrayIndex class would have. This function calls the `__get__` function repeatedly from `0...length-1` and returns the 'flattened' array instance.  ### 'toJSON()' -> Array  All `ArrayIndex` instances get basic support for `JSON.stringify()`, which is the same as a 'flattened' Array being stringified.  ### 'toString()' -> String  The `toString()` override is basically just `array.toArray().toString()`.  ### 'format()' -> String  The `inspect()` implementation for the REPL attempts to mimic what a regular Array looks like in the REPL.

"assert-plus@0.1.5","https://github.com/mcavage/node-assert-plus","MIT*","# node-assert-plus  This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable NODE_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like `assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.

You can check that arrays are of a homogenous type with `Arrayof$Type`:      function test(foo) { 	    assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');     }  You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):      assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');  Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.

Some highlights:  * promiseified method (all wired up) * in a failure scenario, it will wait for pending work before rejecting. This prevents the run-away work problem.  ## Usage  ```sh npm install async-promise-queue ```  or  ```sh yarn add async-promise-queue ```  ### Debug logging  ``` DEBUG='async-promise-queue*' node <your program> ```  And you will be informed when a queue is used, and what its concurrency becomes (note: we can always add more logging, submit your ideas as pull requests!)  ## Example  ```js 'use strict';  const queue = require('async-promise-queue');  queue.async // a reference to the `async` module which `async-promise-queue` is requiring.  // the example worker const worker = queue.async.asyncify(function(work) {   console.log('work', work.file);   return new Promise(resolve => {     if (work.file === '/path-2') { throw new Error('/path-2'); }     if (work.file === '/path-3') { throw new Error('/path-3'); }     setTimeout(resolve, work.duration);   }); });  // the work const work = [   { file:'/path-1',  duration: 1000 },   { file:'/path-2',  duration: 50 },   { file:'/path-3',  duration: 100 },   { file:'/path-4',  duration: 50 }, ];  // calling our queue helper queue(worker, work, 3)   .catch(reason => console.error(reason))   .then(value   => console.log('complete!!', value)) ```"

"binary@0.3.0","https://github.com/substack/node-binary","MIT","binary ======  Unpack multibyte binary values from buffers and streams. You can specify the endianness and signedness of the fields to be unpacked too.  This module is a cleaner and more complete version of [bufferlist](https://github.com/substack/node-bufferlist)'s binary module that runs on pre-allocated buffers instead of a linked list.  [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/substack/node-binary.png)](http://travis-ci.org/substack/node-binary)  examples ========  stream.js ---------  ``` js var binary = require('binary');  var ws = binary()     .word32lu('x')     .word16bs('y')     .word16bu('z')     .tap(function (vars) {         console.dir(vars);     }) ; process.stdin.pipe(ws); process.stdin.resume(); ```  output:  ``` $ node examples/stream.js abcdefgh { x: 1684234849, y: 25958, z: 26472 } ^D ```  parse.js --------  ``` js var buf = new Buffer([ 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 0 ]);  var binary = require('binary'); var vars = binary.parse(buf)     .word16ls('ab')     .word32bu('cf')     .word8('x')     .vars ; console.dir(vars); ```  output:  ``` { ab: 25185, cf: 1667523942, x: 0 } ```  methods =======  `var binary = require('binary')`  var b = binary() ----------------  Return a new writable stream `b` that has the chainable methods documented below for buffering binary input.  binary.parse(buf) -----------------  Parse a static buffer in one pass. Returns a chainable interface with the methods below plus a `vars` field to get at the variable stash as the last item in a chain.  In parse mode, methods will set their keys to `null` if the buffer isn't big enough except `buffer()` and `scan()` which read up up to the end of the buffer and stop.  b.word{8,16,32,64}{l,b}{e,u,s}(key) -----------------------------------  Parse bytes in the buffer or stream given:  * number of bits * endianness ( l : little, b : big ), * signedness ( u and e : unsigned, s : signed )  These functions won't start parsing until all previous parser functions have run and the data is available.  The result of the parse goes into the variable stash at `key`. If `key` has dots (`.`s), it refers to a nested address. If parent container values don't exist they will be created automatically, so for instance you can assign into `dst.addr` and `dst.port` and the `dst` key in the variable stash will be `{ addr : x, port : y }` afterwards.  b.buffer(key, size) -------------------  Take `size` bytes directly off the buffer stream, putting the resulting buffer slice in the variable stash at `key`. If `size` is a string, use the value at `vars[size]`. The key follows the same dotted address rules as the word functions.  b.scan(key, buffer) -------------------  Search for `buffer` in the stream and store all the intervening data in the stash at at `key`, excluding the search buffer. If `buffer` passed as a string, it will be converted into a Buffer internally.  For example, to read in a line you can just do:  ``` js var b = binary()     .scan('line', new Buffer('\r\n'))     .tap(function (vars) {         console.log(vars.line)     }) ; stream.pipe(b); ```  b.tap(cb) ---------  The callback `cb` is provided with the variable stash from all the previous actions once they've all finished.  You can nest additional actions onto `this` inside the callback.  b.into(key, cb) ---------------  Like `.tap()`, except all nested actions will assign into a `key` in the `vars` stash.  b.loop(cb) ----------  Loop, each time calling `cb(end, vars)` for function `end` and the variable stash with `this` set to a new chain for nested parsing. The loop terminates once `end` is called.  b.flush() ---------  Clear the variable stash entirely.  installation ============  To install with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):  ``` npm install binary ```  notes =====  The word64 functions will only return approximations since javascript uses ieee floating point for all number types. Mind the loss of precision.  license =======  MIT"

"brace-expansion@1.1.0","https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion","MIT","# brace-expansion  [Brace expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html),  as known from sh/bash, in JavaScript.  [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/juliangruber/brace-expansion.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/brace-expansion)  [![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion.png)](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion)  ## Example  ```js var expand = require('brace-expansion');  expand('file-{a,b,c}.jpg') // => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']  expand('-v{,,}') // => ['-v', '-v', '-v']  expand('file{0..2}.jpg') // => ['file0.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file2.jpg']  expand('file-{a..c}.jpg') // => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']  expand('file{2..0}.jpg') // => ['file2.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file0.jpg']  expand('file{0..4..2}.jpg') // => ['file0.jpg', 'file2.jpg', 'file4.jpg']  expand('file-{a..e..2}.jpg') // => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-c.jpg', 'file-e.jpg']  expand('file{00..10..5}.jpg') // => ['file00.jpg', 'file05.jpg', 'file10.jpg']  expand('{{A..C},{a..c}}') // => ['A', 'B', 'C', 'a', 'b', 'c']  expand('ppp{,config,oe{,conf}}') // => ['ppp', 'pppconfig', 'pppoe', 'pppoeconf'] ```  ## API  ```js var expand = require('brace-expansion'); ```  ### var expanded = expand(str)  Return an array of all possible and valid expansions of `str`. If none are found, `[str]` is returned.  Valid expansions are:  ```js /^(.*,)+(.+)?$/ // {a,b,...} ```  A comma seperated list of options, like `{a,b}` or `{a,{b,c}}` or `{,a,}`.  ```js /^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/ // {x..y[..incr]} ```  A numeric sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment. If `x` or `y` start with a leading `0`, all the numbers will be padded to have equal length. Negative numbers and backwards iteration work too.  ```js /^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/ // {x..y[..incr]} ```  An alphabetic sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment. `x` and `y` must be exactly one character, and if given, `incr` must be a number.  For compatibility reasons, the string `${` is not eligible for brace expansion.  ## Installation  With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:  ```bash npm install brace-expansion ```  ## Contributors  - [Julian Gruber](https://github.com/juliangruber) - [Isaac Z.

"bser@2.0.0","https://github.com/facebook/watchman","Apache-2.0","# BSER Binary Serialization  BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON. BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of encoded values.  It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating system filename storage.  For more details about the serialization scheme see [Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).  ## API  ```js var bser = require('bser'); ```  ### bser.loadFromBuffer  The is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer, decodes a single value and returns it.  Throws an error if the input is invalid.  ```js var obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf); ```  ### bser.dumpToBuffer  Synchronously encodes a value as BSER.  ```js var encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']); console.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello'] ```  ### BunserBuf  The asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object. You may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the decoded values via its `value` event.  ```js var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();  bunser.on('value', function(obj) {   console.log(obj); }); ```  Then in your socket `data` event:  ```js bunser.append(buf); ```  ## Example  Read BSER from socket:  ```js var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();  bunser.on('value', function(obj) {   console.log('data from socket', obj); });  var socket = net.connect('/socket');  socket.on('data', function(buf) {   bunser.append(buf); }); ```  Write BSER to socket:  ```js socket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj)); ```"

Where possible, operations execute without creating a new Buffer and copying everything over.  This is a cleaner more Buffery rehash of [bufferlist](http://github.com/substack/node-bufferlist).  example =======  slice -----      var Buffers = require('buffers');     var bufs = Buffers();     bufs.push(new Buffer([1,2,3]));     bufs.push(new Buffer([4,5,6,7]));     bufs.push(new Buffer([8,9,10]));          console.dir(bufs.slice(2,8))  output:      $ node examples/slice.js      <Buffer 03 04 05 06 07 08>  splice ------      var Buffers = require('buffers');     var bufs = Buffers([         new Buffer([1,2,3]),         new Buffer([4,5,6,7]),         new Buffer([8,9,10]),     ]);          var removed = bufs.splice(2, 4);     console.dir({         removed : removed.slice(),         bufs : bufs.slice(),     });      output:      $ node examples/splice.js     { removed: <Buffer 03 04 05 06>,       bufs: <Buffer 01 02 07 08 09 0a> }  methods =======  Buffers(buffers) ----------------  Create a Buffers with an array of `Buffer`s if specified, else `[]`.  .push(buf1, buf2...) --------------------  Push buffers onto the end. Just like `Array.prototype.push`.  .unshift(buf1, buf2...) -----------------------  Unshift buffers onto the head. Just like `Array.prototype.unshift`.  .slice(i, j) ------------  Slice a range out of the buffer collection as if it were contiguous. Works just like the `Array.prototype.slice` version.  .splice(i, howMany, replacements) ---------------------------------  Splice the buffer collection as if it were contiguous. Works just like `Array.prototype.splice`, even the replacement part!  .copy(dst, dstStart, start, end) --------------------------------  Copy the buffer collection as if it were contiguous to the `dst` Buffer with the specified bounds. Works just like `Buffer.prototype.copy`.  .get(i) -------  Get a single element at index `i`.  .set(i, x) ----------  Set a single element's value at index `i`.  .indexOf(needle, offset) ----------  Find a string or buffer `needle` inside the buffer collection. Returns the position of the search string or -1 if the search string was not found.  Provide an `offset` to skip that number of characters at the beginning of the search. This can be used to find additional matches.  This function will return the correct result even if the search string is spread out over multiple internal buffers.  .toBuffer() -----------  Convert the buffer collection to a single buffer, equivalent with `.slice(0, buffers.length)`;  .toString(encoding, start, end) -----------  Decodes and returns a string from the buffer collection. Works just like `Buffer.prototype.toString`"

The statement-tracking functions will be added to `context` by `assign()`."
"burrito@0.2.12","https://github.com/substack/node-burrito","BSD*","burrito =======  Burrito makes it easy to do crazy stuff with the javascript AST.  This is super useful if you want to roll your own stack traces or build a code coverage tool.  [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/substack/node-burrito.png)](http://travis-ci.org/substack/node-burrito)  ![node.wrap('burrito')](http://substack.net/images/burrito.png)  examples ========  microwave ---------  examples/microwave.js  ````javascript var burrito = require('burrito');  var res = burrito.microwave('Math.sin(2)', function (node) {     if (node.name === 'num') node.wrap('Math.PI / %s'); });  console.log(res); // sin(pi / 2) == 1 ````  output:      1  wrap ----  examples/wrap.js  ````javascript var burrito = require('burrito');  var src = burrito('f() && g(h())\nfoo()', function (node) {     if (node.name === 'call') node.wrap('qqq(%s)'); });  console.log(src); ````  output:      qqq(f()) && qqq(g(qqq(h())));      qqq(foo());  methods =======      var burrito = require('burrito');  burrito(code, cb) -----------------  Given some source `code` and a function `trace`, walk the ast by expression.  The `cb` gets called with a node object described below.  If `code` is an Array then it is assumbed to be an AST which you can generate yourself with `burrito.parse()`. The AST must be annotated, so make sure to `burrito.parse(src, false, true)`.  burrito.microwave(code, context={}, cb) ---------------------------------------  Like `burrito()` except the result is run using `vm.runInNewContext(res, context)`.  node object ===========  node.name ---------  Name is a string that contains the type of the expression as named by uglify.  node.wrap(s) ------------  Wrap the current expression in `s`.  If `s` is a string, `'%s'` will be replaced with the stringified current expression.  If `s` is a function, it is called with the stringified current expression and should return a new stringified expression.  If the `node.name === 'binary'`, you get the subterms '%a' and '%b' to play with too. These subterms are applied if `s` is a function too: `s(expr, a, b)`.  Protip: to insert multiple statements you can use javascript's lesser-known block syntax that it gets from C:  ````javascript if (node.name === 'stat') node.wrap('{ foo(); %s }') ````  node.node ---------  raw ast data generated by uglify  node.value ----------  `node.node.slice(1)` to skip the annotations  node.start ----------  The start location of the expression, like this:  ````javascript { type: 'name',   value: 'b',   line: 0,   col: 3,   pos: 3,   nlb: false,   comments_before: [] } ````  node.end --------  The end  location of the expression, formatted the same as `node.start`.  node.state ----------  The state of the traversal using traverse.  node.source() -------------  Returns a stringified version of the expression.  node.parent() -------------  Returns the parent `node` or `null` if the node is the root element.  node.label() ------------  Return the label of the present node or `null` if there is no label.  Labels are returned for 'call', 'var', 'defun', and 'function' nodes.  Returns an array for 'var' nodes since `var` statements can contain multiple labels in assignment.  install =======  With [npm](http://npmjs.org) you can just:      npm install burrito  in the browser ==============  Burrito works in browser with [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).  It has been tested against:  * Internet Explorer 5.5, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 * Firefox 3.5 * Chrome 6.0 * Opera 10.6 * Safari 5.0  kudos =====  Heavily inspired by (and previously mostly lifted outright from) isaacs's nifty tmp/instrument.js thingy from uglify-js."

Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this           Public License.         3.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified           form), You must:              a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor                with the Licensed Material:                   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed                     Material and any others designated to receive                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if                     designated);                  ii. a copyright notice;                 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;                  iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of                     warranties;                   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the                     extent reasonably practicable;              b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and              c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or                hyperlink to, this Public License.         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required           information.         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent           reasonably practicable.         4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's           License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted           Material from complying with this Public License.   Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial      portion of the contents of the database;    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.   Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.    b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and      waiver of all liability.   Section 6 -- Term and Termination.    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License      terminate automatically.    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under      Section 6(a), it reinstates:         1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the           violation; or         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations      of this Public License.    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so      will not terminate this Public License.    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public      License.   Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.   Section 8 -- Interpretation.    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully      be made without permission under this Public License.    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and      conditions.    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the      Licensor.    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.   =======================================================================  Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

"chainsaw@0.1.0","https://github.com/substack/node-chainsaw","MIT*","Chainsaw ========  Build chainable fluent interfaces the easy way in node.js.  With this meta-module you can write modules with chainable interfaces. Chainsaw takes care of all of the boring details and makes nested flow control super simple too.  Just call `Chainsaw` with a constructor function like in the examples below. In your methods, just do `saw.next()` to move along to the next event and `saw.nest()` to create a nested chain.

In full mode, every action is recorded, which allows you to replay actions using the `jump()`, `trap()` and `down()` methods.  However, if your chainsaws are long-lived, recording every action can consume a tremendous amount of memory, so we also offer a 'light' mode where actions are not recorded and the aforementioned methods are disabled.

Although there are other ones, they either do too much or not enough.  **Chalk is a clean and focused alternative.**  ![screenshot](screenshot.png)   ## Why  - **Doesn't extend String.prototype** - Expressive API - Clean and focused - Auto-detects color support - Actively maintained - [Used by 150+ modules](https://npmjs.org/browse/depended/chalk)   ## Install  Install with [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/chalk): `npm install --save chalk`   ## Example  Chalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain and nest the styles you want.  ```js var chalk = require('chalk');  // style a string console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello world!')  );  // combine styled and normal strings console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello'), 'World' + chalk.red('!')  );  // compose multiple styles using the chainable API console.log(  chalk.blue.bgRed.bold('Hello world!')  );  // nest styles console.log(  chalk.red('Hello', chalk.underline.bgBlue('world') + '!')  );  // pass in multiple arguments console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello', 'World!', 'Foo', 'bar', 'biz', 'baz')  ); ```  You can easily define your own themes.  ```js var chalk = require('chalk'); var error = chalk.bold.red; console.log(error('Error!')); ```   ## API  ### chalk.`<style>[.<style>...](string, [string...])`  Example: `chalk.red.bold.underline('Hello', 'world');`  Chain [styles](#styles) and call the last one as a method with a string argument. Order doesn't matter.  Multiple arguments will be separated by space.  ### chalk.enabled  Color support is automatically detected, but you can override it.  ### chalk.supportsColor  Detect whether the terminal [supports color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/has-color).  Can be overridden by the user with the flags `--color` and `--no-color`.  Used internally and handled for you, but exposed for convenience.  ### chalk.styles  Exposes the styles as [ANSI escape codes](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-styles).  Generally not useful, but you might need just the `.open` or `.close` escape code if you're mixing externally styled strings with yours.  ```js var chalk = require('chalk');  console.log(chalk.styles.red); //=> {open: '\x1b[31m', close: '\x1b[39m'}  console.log(chalk.styles.red.open + 'Hello' + chalk.styles.red.close); ```  ### chalk.stripColor(string)  [Strip color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-ansi) from a string.  Can be useful in combination with `.supportsColor` to strip color on externally styled text when it's not supported.  Example:  ```js var chalk = require('chalk'); var styledString = fromExternal();  if (!chalk.supportsColor) { 	chalk.stripColor(styledString); } ```   ## Styles  ### General  - reset - bold - italic - underline - inverse - strikethrough  ### Text colors  - black - red - green - yellow - blue - magenta - cyan - white - gray  ### Background colors  - bgBlack - bgRed - bgGreen - bgYellow - bgBlue - bgMagenta - bgCyan - bgWhite   ## License  MIT © [Sindre Sorhus](http://sindresorhus.com)   -  [![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/sindresorhus/chalk/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free 'Bitdeli Badge')"

They require a `head` setting when instantiated that has an empty string as the first header 2. The individual rows take the general form of { 'Header': ['Row', 'Values'] }  ```javascript var Table = require('cli-table'); var table = new Table({ head: ['', 'Top Header 1', 'Top Header 2'] });  table.push(     { 'Left Header 1': ['Value Row 1 Col 1', 'Value Row 1 Col 2'] }   , { 'Left Header 2': ['Value Row 2 Col 1', 'Value Row 2 Col 2'] } );  console.log(table.toString()); ```  ### Custom styles The ```chars``` property controls how the table is drawn: ```javascript var table = new Table({   chars: { 'top': '═' , 'top-mid': '╤' , 'top-left': '╔' , 'top-right': '╗'          , 'bottom': '═' , 'bottom-mid': '╧' , 'bottom-left': '╚' , 'bottom-right': '╝'          , 'left': '║' , 'left-mid': '╟' , 'mid': '─' , 'mid-mid': '┼'          , 'right': '║' , 'right-mid': '╢' , 'middle': '│' } });  table.push(     ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']   , ['frob', 'bar', 'quuz'] );  console.log(table.toString()); // Outputs: // //╔══════╤═════╤══════╗ //║ foo  │ bar │ baz  ║ //╟──────┼─────┼──────╢ //║ frob │ bar │ quuz ║ //╚══════╧═════╧══════╝ ```  Empty decoration lines will be skipped, to avoid vertical separator rows just set the 'mid', 'left-mid', 'mid-mid', 'right-mid' to the empty string: ```javascript var table = new Table({ chars: {'mid': '', 'left-mid': '', 'mid-mid': '', 'right-mid': ''} }); table.push(     ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']   , ['frobnicate', 'bar', 'quuz'] );  console.log(table.toString()); // Outputs: (note the lack of the horizontal line between rows) //┌────────────┬─────┬──────┐ //│ foo        │ bar │ baz  │ //│ frobnicate │ bar │ quuz │ //└────────────┴─────┴──────┘ ```  By setting all chars to empty with the exception of 'middle' being set to a single space and by setting padding to zero, it's possible to get the most compact layout with no decorations: ```javascript var table = new Table({   chars: { 'top': '' , 'top-mid': '' , 'top-left': '' , 'top-right': ''          , 'bottom': '' , 'bottom-mid': '' , 'bottom-left': '' , 'bottom-right': ''          , 'left': '' , 'left-mid': '' , 'mid': '' , 'mid-mid': ''          , 'right': '' , 'right-mid': '' , 'middle': ' ' },   style: { 'padding-left': 0, 'padding-right': 0 } });  table.push(     ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']   , ['frobnicate', 'bar', 'quuz'] );  console.log(table.toString()); // Outputs: //foo        bar baz //frobnicate bar quuz ```  ## Running tests  Clone the repository with all its submodules and run:  ```bash $ make test ```  ## Credits  - Guillermo Rauch &lt;guillermo@learnboost.com&gt; ([Guille](http://github.com/guille))  ## License   (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2010 LearnBoost &lt;dev@learnboost.com&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"cli@0.6.6","https://github.com/chriso/cli","MIT","**cli is a toolkit for rapidly building command line apps - it includes:**  - Full featured opts/args parser - Plugin support for adding common options and switches - Helper methods for working with input/output and spawning child processes - Output colored/styled messages, [progress bars](https://github.com/chriso/cli/blob/master/examples/progress.js) or [spinners](https://github.com/chriso/cli/blob/master/examples/spinner.js) - Command [auto-completion](https://github.com/chriso/cli/blob/master/examples/command.js) and [glob support](https://github.com/chriso/cli/blob/master/examples/glob.js)  Install using `npm install cli` or just bundle [cli.js](https://github.com/chriso/cli/raw/master/cli.js) with your app.  ## Example apps  ### sort.js  ```javascript #!/usr/bin/env node require('cli').withStdinLines(function(lines, newline) {     this.output(lines.sort().join(newline)); }); ```  Try it out  ```bash $ ./sort.js < input.txt ```  Let's add support for an `-n` switch to use a numeric sort, and a `-r` switch to reverse output - only 5 extra lines of code (!)  ```javascript var cli = require('cli'), options = cli.parse();  cli.withStdinLines(function(lines, newline) {     lines.sort(!options.n ? null : function(a, b) {         return parseInt(a) > parseInt(b);     });     if (options.r) lines.reverse();     this.output(lines.join(newline)); }); ```  ### static.js  Let's create a static file server with daemon support to see the opts parser + plugins in use - note: this requires `npm install creationix daemon`  ```javascript var cli = require('cli').enable('daemon', 'status'); //Enable 2 plugins  cli.parse({     log:   ['l', 'Enable logging'],     port:  ['p', 'Listen on this port', 'number', 8080],     serve: [false, 'Serve static files from PATH', 'path', './public'] });  cli.main(function(args, options) {     var server, middleware = [];      if (options.log) {         this.debug('Enabling logging');         middleware.push(require('creationix/log')());     }      this.debug('Serving files from ' + options.serve);     middleware.push(require('creationix/static')('/', options.serve, 'index.html'));      server = this.createServer(middleware).listen(options.port);      this.ok('Listening on port ' + options.port); }); ```  To output usage information  ```bash $ ./static.js --help ```  To create a daemon that serves files from */tmp*, run  ```bash $ ./static.js -ld --serve=/tmp ```  For more examples, see [./examples](https://github.com/chriso/cli/tree/master/examples)  ## Helper methods  cli has methods that collect stdin (newline is autodetected as \n or \r\n)  ```javascript cli.withStdin(callback);        //callback receives stdin as a string cli.withStdinLines(callback);   //callback receives stdin split into an array of lines (lines, newline) ```  cli also has a lower level method for working with input line by line (see [./examples/cat.js](https://github.com/chriso/cli/blob/master/examples/cat.js) for an example).   ```javascript cli.withInput(file, function (line, newline, eof) {     if (!eof) {         this.output(line + newline);     } }); ```  *Note: `file` can be omitted if you want to work with stdin*  To output a progress bar, call  ```javascript cli.progress(progress); //Where 0 <= progress <= 1 ```  To spawn a child process, use  ```javascript cli.exec(cmd, callback); //callback receives the output of the process (split into lines) ```  cli also comes bundled with kof's [node-natives](https://github.com/kof/node-natives) (access with cli.native) and creationix' [stack](https://github.com/creationix/stack) (access with cli.createServer)  ## Plugins  Plugins are a way of adding common opts and can be enabled using   ```javascript cli.enable(plugin1, [plugin2, ...]);  //To disable, use the equivalent disable() method ```  **help** - *enabled by default*  Adds `-h,--help` to output auto-generated usage information  **version**  Adds `-v,--version` to output version information for the app. cli will attempt to locate and parse a nearby *package.json*  To set your own app name and version, use `cli.setApp(app_name, version)`  **status**  Adds options to show/hide the stylized status messages that are output to the console when using one of these methods  ```javascript cli.debug(msg);  //Only shown when using --debug cli.error(msg); cli.fatal(msg);  //Exits the process after outputting msg cli.info(msg); cli.ok(msg); ```  `-k,--no-color` will omit ANSI color escapes from the output  **glob**  - *requires* `npm install glob`  Enables glob matching of arguments  **daemon**  - *requires* `npm install daemon`  Adds `-d,--daemon ARG` for daemonizing the process and controlling the resulting daemon  `ARG` can be either start (default), stop, restart, pid (outputs the daemon's pid if it's running), or log (output the daemon's stdout+stderr)  **timeout**  Adds `-t,--timeout N` to exit the process after N seconds with an error  **catchall**  Adds `-c,--catch` to catch and output uncaughtExceptions and resume execution  *Note: Plugins are automatically disabled if an option or switch of the same name is already defined*  ## LICENSE  (MIT license)  Copyright (c) 2010 Chris O'Hara <cohara87@gmail.com>  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

The super nifty way  ```js var colors = require('colors');  console.log('hello'.green); // outputs green text console.log('i like cake and pies'.underline.red) // outputs red underlined text console.log('inverse the color'.inverse); // inverses the color console.log('OMG Rainbows!'.rainbow); // rainbow console.log('Run the trap'.trap); // Drops the bass  ```  or a slightly less nifty way which doesn't extend `String.prototype`  ```js var colors = require('colors/safe');  console.log(colors.green('hello')); // outputs green text console.log(colors.red.underline('i like cake and pies')) // outputs red underlined text console.log(colors.inverse('inverse the color')); // inverses the color console.log(colors.rainbow('OMG Rainbows!')); // rainbow console.log(colors.trap('Run the trap')); // Drops the bass  ```  I prefer the first way. Some people seem to be afraid of extending `String.prototype` and prefer the second way.   If you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch `String.prototype`, the second usage will not touch `String` native object.  ## Disabling Colors  To disable colors you can pass the following arguments in the command line to your application:  ```bash node myapp.js --no-color ```  ## Console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data)  ```js var name = 'Marak'; console.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name); // outputs -> 'Hello Marak' ```  ## Custom themes  ### Using standard API  ```js  var colors = require('colors');  colors.setTheme({   silly: 'rainbow',   input: 'grey',   verbose: 'cyan',   prompt: 'grey',   info: 'green',   data: 'grey',   help: 'cyan',   warn: 'yellow',   debug: 'blue',   error: 'red' });  // outputs red text console.log('this is an error'.error);  // outputs yellow text console.log('this is a warning'.warn); ```  ### Using string safe API  ```js var colors = require('colors/safe');  // set single property var error = colors.red; error('this is red');  // set theme colors.setTheme({   silly: 'rainbow',   input: 'grey',   verbose: 'cyan',   prompt: 'grey',   info: 'green',   data: 'grey',   help: 'cyan',   warn: 'yellow',   debug: 'blue',   error: 'red' });  // outputs red text console.log(colors.error('this is an error'));  // outputs yellow text console.log(colors.warn('this is a warning')); ```  *Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in `colors`. If you find the style you can summon him.*"

The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.  ```js #!/usr/bin/env node  /**  * Module dependencies.  */  var program = require('commander');  program   .version('0.0.1')   .option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')   .option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')   .option('-b, --bbq', 'Add bbq sauce')   .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add the specified type of cheese [marble]', 'marble')   .parse(process.argv);  console.log('you ordered a pizza with:'); if (program.peppers) console.log('  - peppers'); if (program.pineapple) console.log('  - pineapple'); if (program.bbq) console.log('  - bbq'); console.log('  - %s cheese', program.cheese); ```   Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as '--template-engine' are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.  ## Automated --help   The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:  ```    $ ./examples/pizza --help     Usage: pizza [options]     Options:       -V, --version        output the version number      -p, --peppers        Add peppers      -P, --pineapple      Add pineapple      -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce      -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]      -h, --help           output usage information  ```  ## Coercion  ```js function range(val) {   return val.split('..').map(Number); }  function list(val) {   return val.split(','); }  program   .version('0.0.1')   .usage('[options] <file ...>')   .option('-i, --integer <n>', 'An integer argument', parseInt)   .option('-f, --float <n>', 'A float argument', parseFloat)   .option('-r, --range <a>..<b>', 'A range', range)   .option('-l, --list <items>', 'A list', list)   .option('-o, --optional [value]', 'An optional value')   .parse(process.argv);  console.log(' int: %j', program.integer); console.log(' float: %j', program.float); console.log(' optional: %j', program.optional); program.range = program.range || []; console.log(' range: %j..%j', program.range[0], program.range[1]); console.log(' list: %j', program.list); console.log(' args: %j', program.args); ```  ## Custom help   You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information  by listening for '--help'.

Config is stored in a YAML file to make it simple for users to edit the config directly themselves. The file is located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `~/.config`. Eg: `~/.config/configstore/id-of-your-choosing.yml`   ## Usage  ```js var Configstore = require('configstore'); var packageName = require('./package').name;  // Init a Configstore instance with an unique ID eg. package name // and optionally some default values var conf = new Configstore(packageName, { foo: 'bar' });  conf.set('awesome', true); console.log(conf.get('awesome'));  // true console.log(conf.get('foo'));      // bar  conf.del('awesome'); console.log(conf.get('awesome'));  // undefined ```   ## Documentation  ### Methods  #### .set(key, val)  Set an item  #### .get(key)  Get an item  #### .del(key)  Delete an item  ### Properties  #### .all  Get all items as an object or replace the current config with an object:  ```js conf.all = { 	hello: 'world' }; ```  #### .size  Get the item count  #### .path  Get the path to the config file. Can be used to show the user where the config file is located or even better open it for them.   ## License  [BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)   Copyright Google"

Replace swig with whatever templating you are using. For example, use cons.hogan for hogan.js, cons.jade for jade, etc. `console.log(cons)` for the full list of identifiers.  ```js var cons = require('consolidate'); cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){   if (err) throw err;   console.log(html); }); ```    Or without options / local variables:  ```js var cons = require('consolidate'); cons.swig('views/page.html', function(err, html){   if (err) throw err;   console.log(html); }); ```    To dynamically pass the engine, simply use the subscript operator and a variable:  ```js var cons = require('consolidate')   , name = 'swig';  cons[name]('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){   if (err) throw err;   console.log(html); }); ```  ## Caching   To enable or disable caching simply pass `{ cache: true/false }`. Engines _may_ use this option to cache things reading the file contents, compiled `Function`s etc. Engines which do _not_ support this may simply ignore it. All engines that consolidate.js implements I/O for will cache the file contents, ideal for production environments.  ```js var cons = require('consolidate'); cons.swig('views/page.html', { cache: false, user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){   if (err) throw err;   console.log(html); }); ```  ## Express 3.x example  ```js var express = require('express')   , cons = require('consolidate')   , app = express();  // assign the swig engine to .html files app.engine('html', cons.swig);  // set .html as the default extension app.set('view engine', 'html'); app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');  var users = []; users.push({ name: 'tobi' }); users.push({ name: 'loki' }); users.push({ name: 'jane' });  app.get('/', function(req, res){   res.render('index', {     title: 'Consolidate.js'   }); });  app.get('/users', function(req, res){   res.render('users', {     title: 'Users',     users: users   }); });  app.listen(3000); console.log('Express server listening on port 3000'); ```  ## Template Engine Instances  Template engines are exposed via the `cons.requires` object, but they are not instantiated until you've called the `cons[engine].render()` method. You can instantiate them manually beforehand if you want to add filters, globals, mixins, or other engine features.  ```js var cons = require('consolidate'),   nunjucks = require('nunjucks');  // add nunjucks to requires so filters can be // added and the same instance will be used inside the render method cons.requires.nunjucks = nunjucks;  cons.requires.nunjucks.addFilter('foo', function () {   return 'bar'; }); ```  ## Notes  * You can pass **partials** with `options.partials` * For using **template inheritance** with nunjucks, you can pass a loader   with `options.loader`. * To use **filters** with tinyliquid, use `options.filters` and specify an array of properties, each of which is a named filter function. A filter function takes a string as a parameter and returns a modified version of it. * To use **custom tags** with tinyliquid, use `options.customTags` to specify an array of tag functions that follow the tinyliquid [custom tag](https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid/wiki/Custom-Tag) definition. * The default directory used with the **include** tag with tinyliquid is the current working directory. To override this, use `options.includeDir`. * `React` To render content into a html base template (eg. `index.html` of your React app), pass the path of the template with `options.base`.  ## Running tests    Install dev deps:      $ npm install -d    Run the tests:      $ make test  ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"debug@2.0.0","https://github.com/visionmedia/debug","MIT*","# debug    tiny node.js debugging utility modelled after node core's debugging technique.  ## Installation  ```bash $ npm install debug ```  ## Usage   With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` format string goodies you're used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.  Example _app.js_:  ```js var debug = require('debug')('http')   , http = require('http')   , name = 'My App';  // fake app  debug('booting %s', name);  http.createServer(function(req, res){   debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);   res.end('hello\n'); }).listen(3000, function(){   debug('listening'); });  // fake worker of some kind  require('./worker'); ```  Example _worker.js_:  ```js var debug = require('debug')('worker');  setInterval(function(){   debug('doing some work'); }, 1000); ```   The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:    ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)    ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)  ## Millisecond diff    When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the '+NNNms' will show you how much time was spent between calls.    ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)    When stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:    ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)  ## Conventions   If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use ':' to separate features. For example 'bodyParser' from Connect would then be 'connect:bodyParser'.  ## Wildcards    The `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named 'connect:bodyParser', 'connect:compress', 'connect:session', instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect.compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.    You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a '-' character.  For example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with 'connect:'.  ## Browser support    Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. For example if you have `worker:a` and `worker:b` as shown below, and wish to debug both type `debug.enable('worker:*')` in the console and refresh the page, this will remain until you disable with `debug.disable()`.  ```js a = debug('worker:a'); b = debug('worker:b');  setInterval(function(){   a('doing some work'); }, 1000);  setInterval(function(){   b('doing some work'); }, 1200); ```  #### Web Inspector Colors    Colors are also enabled on 'Web Inspectors' that understand the `%c` formatting   option. These are WebKit web inspectors, Firefox ([since version   31](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/editable-box-model-multiple-selection-sublime-text-keys-much-more-firefox-developer-tools-episode-31/))   and the Firebug plugin for Firefox (any version).    Colored output looks something like:    ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/71256/3139768/b98c5fd8-e8ef-11e3-862a-f7253b6f47c6.png)  ### stderr vs stdout  You can set an alternative logging method per-namespace by overriding the `log` method on a per-namespace or globally:  Example _stderr.js_:  ```js var debug = require('../'); var log = debug('app:log');  // by default console.log is used log('goes to stdout!');  var error = debug('app:error'); // set this namespace to log via console.error error.log = console.error.bind(console); // don't forget to bind to console! error('goes to stderr'); log('still goes to stdout!');  // set all output to go via console.warn // overrides all per-namespace log settings debug.log = console.warn.bind(console); log('now goes to stderr via console.warn'); error('still goes to stderr, but via console.warn now'); ```  ## Authors   - TJ Holowaychuk  - Nathan Rajlich  ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2014 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

The value passed to the `extract` event is a basic log of each file and how it was compressed.  **Options** - **path** *String* - Path to extract into (default `.`) - **follow** *Boolean* - If true, rather than create stored symlinks as symlinks make a shallow copy of the target instead (default `false`) - **filter** *Function* - A function that will be called once for each file in the archive. It takes one argument which is an object containing details of the file. Return true for any file that you want to extract, and false otherwise. (default `null`) - **strip** *Number* - Remove leading folders in the path structure. Equivalent to `--strip-components` for tar.  ```js var DecompressZip = require('decompress-zip'); var unzipper = new DecompressZip(filename)  unzipper.on('error', function (err) {     console.log('Caught an error'); });  unzipper.on('extract', function (log) {     console.log('Finished extracting'); });  unzipper.on('progress', function (fileIndex, fileCount) {     console.log('Extracted file ' + (fileIndex + 1) + ' of ' + fileCount); });  unzipper.extract({     path: 'some/path',     filter: function (file) {         return file.type !== 'SymbolicLink';     } }); ```  If `path` does not exist, decompress-zip will attempt to create it first.  ### .list()  Much like extract, except: - the success event is `list` - the data for the event is an array of paths - no files are actually extracted - there are no options  ```js var DecompressZip = require('decompress-zip'); var unzipper = new DecompressZip(filename)  unzipper.on('error', function (err) {     console.log('Caught an error'); });  unzipper.on('list', function (files) {     console.log('The archive contains:');     console.log(files); });  unzipper.list(); ```   ## License  MIT © Bower team"

"diff@1.4.0","https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff","BSD","# jsdiff  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kpdecker/jsdiff.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kpdecker/jsdiff)  A javascript text differencing implementation.  Based on the algorithm proposed in ['An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations' (Myers, 1986)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.4.6927).  ## Installation      npm install diff  or      bower install jsdiff  or      git clone git://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff.git  ## API  * `JsDiff.diffChars(oldStr, newStr[, callback])` - diffs two blocks of text, comparing character by character.      Returns a list of change objects (See below).  * `JsDiff.diffWords(oldStr, newStr[, callback])` - diffs two blocks of text, comparing word by word, ignoring whitespace.      Returns a list of change objects (See below).  * `JsDiff.diffWordsWithSpace(oldStr, newStr[, callback])` - diffs two blocks of text, comparing word by word, treating whitespace as significant.      Returns a list of change objects (See below).  * `JsDiff.diffLines(oldStr, newStr[, callback])` - diffs two blocks of text, comparing line by line.      Returns a list of change objects (See below).  * `JsDiff.diffTrimmedLines(oldStr, newStr[, callback])` - diffs two blocks of text, comparing line by line, ignoring leading and trailing whitespace.      Returns a list of change objects (See below).  * `JsDiff.diffSentences(oldStr, newStr[, callback])` - diffs two blocks of text, comparing sentence by sentence.      Returns a list of change objects (See below).  * `JsDiff.diffCss(oldStr, newStr[, callback])` - diffs two blocks of text, comparing CSS tokens.      Returns a list of change objects (See below).  * `JsDiff.diffJson(oldObj, newObj[, callback])` - diffs two JSON objects, comparing the fields defined on each. The order of fields, etc does not matter in this comparison.      Returns a list of change objects (See below).  * `JsDiff.createTwoFilesPatch(oldFileName, newFileName, oldStr, newStr, oldHeader, newHeader)` - creates a unified diff patch.      Parameters:     * `oldFileName` : String to be output in the filename section of the patch for the removals     * `newFileName` : String to be output in the filename section of the patch for the additions     * `oldStr` : Original string value     * `newStr` : New string value     * `oldHeader` : Additional information to include in the old file header     * `newHeader` : Additional information to include in thew new file header  * `JsDiff.createPatch(fileName, oldStr, newStr, oldHeader, newHeader)` - creates a unified diff patch.      Just like JsDiff.createTwoFilesPatch, but with oldFileName being equal to newFileName.  * `JsDiff.applyPatch(oldStr, diffStr)` - applies a unified diff patch.      Return a string containing new version of provided data.  * `convertChangesToXML(changes)` - converts a list of changes to a serialized XML format   All methods above which accept the optional callback method will run in sync mode when that parameter is omitted and in async mode when supplied. This allows for larger diffs without blocking the event loop.  ### Change Objects Many of the methods above return change objects. These objects are consist of the following fields:  * `value`: Text content * `added`: True if the value was inserted into the new string * `removed`: True of the value was removed from the old string  Note that some cases may omit a particular flag field. Comparison on the flag fields should always be done in a truthy or falsy manner.  ## Examples  Basic example in Node  ```js require('colors') var jsdiff = require('diff');  var one = 'beep boop'; var other = 'beep boob blah';  var diff = jsdiff.diffChars(one, other);  diff.forEach(function(part){   // green for additions, red for deletions   // grey for common parts   var color = part.added ? 'green' :     part.removed ? 'red' : 'grey';   process.stderr.write(part.value[color]); });  console.log() ``` Running the above program should yield  <img src='images/node_example.png' alt='Node Example'>  Basic example in a web page  ```html <pre id='display'></pre> <script src='diff.js'></script> <script> var one = 'beep boop'; var other = 'beep boob blah';  var diff = JsDiff.diffChars(one, other);  diff.forEach(function(part){   // green for additions, red for deletions   // grey for common parts   var color = part.added ? 'green' :     part.removed ? 'red' : 'grey';   var span = document.createElement('span');   span.style.color = color;   span.appendChild(document     .createTextNode(part.value));   display.appendChild(span); }); </script> ```  Open the above .html file in a browser and you should see  <img src='images/web_example.png' alt='Node Example'>  **[Full online demo](http://kpdecker.github.com/jsdiff)**  ## License  Software License Agreement (BSD License)  Copyright (c) 2009-2011, Kevin Decker kpdecker@gmail.com  All rights reserved.

If `opts.indent` is set, output will span multiple lines and `opts.indent` spaces will be used for leading whitespace.  If `opts.comma === 'first'` then commas will be placed at the start of lines.  Setting `opts.comment` to `true` will turn on comments with the previous contents like this:  ![object comments](http://substack.net/images/screenshots/difflet_object_comments.png)  diff(prev, next) ----------------  Return a stream with the colorful changes between objects `prev` and `next`.  diff.compare(prev, next) ------------------------  Return a string with the colorful changes between `prev` and `next`.  difflet.compare(prev, next) ---------------------------  Return a string with the colorful changes between `prev` and `next` with the default options.  install =======  With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:  ``` npm install difflet ```  test ====  With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:  ``` npm test ```  license =======  MIT/X11"

"dotenv@1.2.0","https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv","BSD-2-Clause","# dotenv  <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motdotla/dotenv/master/dotenv.png' alt='dotenv' align='right' />  Dotenv loads environment variables from `.env` into `ENV` (process.env).  [![BuildStatus](https://img.shields.io/travis/motdotla/dotenv/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/motdotla/dotenv) [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dotenv.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/feross/standard)  > 'Storing [configuration in the environment](http://www.12factor.net/config) > is one of the tenets of a [twelve-factor app](http://www.12factor.net/). > Anything that is likely to change between deployment environments–such as > resource handles for databases or credentials for external services–should be > extracted from the code into environment variables. > > But it is not always practical to set environment variables on development > machines or continuous integration servers where multiple projects are run. > Dotenv loads variables from a `.env` file into ENV when the environment is > bootstrapped.' > > [Brandon Keepers' Dotenv in Ruby](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)  ## Install  ```bash npm install dotenv --save ```  ## Usage  As early as possible in your application, require and load dotenv.  ```javascript require('dotenv').load(); ```  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of `NAME=VALUE`. For example:  ``` DB_HOST=localhost DB_USER=root DB_PASS=s1mpl3 ```  That's it.  `process.env` now has the keys and values you defined in your `.env` file.  ```javascript db.connect({   host: process.env.DB_HOST,   username: process.env.DB_USER,   password: process.env.DB_PASS }); ```  ### Preload  If you are using iojs-v1.6.0 or later, you can use the `--require` (`-r`) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.   ```bash $ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js ```  The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format `dotenv_config_<option>=value`  ```bash $ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/your/env/vars ```  ## Config  `config` will read your .env file, parse the contents, and assign it to `process.env` - just like `load` does. You can additionally, pass options to `config`.  Note: `config` and `load` are synonyms. You can pass options to either.  ### Options  #### Silent  Default: `false`  Dotenv outputs a warning to your console if missing a `.env` file. Suppress this warning using silent.  ```js require('dotenv').config({silent: true}); ```  #### Path  Default: `.env`  You can specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is named or located differently.  ```js require('dotenv').config({path: '/custom/path/to/your/env/vars'}); ```  #### Encoding  Default: `utf8`  You may specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables using this option.  ```js require('dotenv').config({encoding: 'base64'}); ```  ## Parse  The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.  ```js var dotenv  = require('dotenv'); var buf    = new Buffer('BASIC=basic'); var config  = dotenv.parse(buf); // will return an object console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' } ```  ### Rules  The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:  - `BASIC=basic` becomes `{BASIC: 'basic'}` - empty lines are skipped - lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments - empty values become empty strings (`EMPTY=` becomes `{EMPTY: ''}`) - single and double quoted values are escaped (`SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted'` becomes `{SINGLE_QUOTE: 'quoted'}`) - new lines are expanded if in double quotes (`MULTILINE='new\nline'` becomes  ``` {MULTILINE: 'new line'} ``` - inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (`JSON={'foo': 'bar'}` becomes `{JSON:'{\'foo\': \'bar\'}'`)  #### Expanding Variables  Basic variable expansion is supported.  ``` BASIC=basic TEST=$BASIC ```  Parsing that would result in `{BASIC: 'basic', TEST: 'basic'}`. You can escape variables by quoting or beginning with `\` (e.g. `TEST=\$BASIC`). If the variable is not found in the file, `process.env` is checked. Missing variables result in an empty string.  ``` BASIC=basic TEST=$TEST DNE=$DNE ```  ```bash TEST=example node -e 'require('dotenv').config();' ```  - `process.env.BASIC` would equal `basic` - `process.env.TEST` would equal `example` - `process.env.DNE` would equal `''`  ## FAQ  ### Should I commit my .env file?  No. We **strongly** recommend against committing your .env file to version control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different password than your development database.  ## Contributing  See [Contributing Guide](Contributing.md)  ## Who's using dotenv  Here's just a few of many repositories using dotenv:  * [npm](https://github.com/npm/newww) * [sendgrid-nodejs](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs) * [handshake.js](https://github.com/handshakejs/handshakejs-api) * [google-oauth2-service-account](https://github.com/jacoblwe20/google-oauth2-service-account) * [kibble](https://github.com/motdotla/kibble) * [github-streaker](https://github.com/motdotla/github-streaker)"

"ember-cli-content-security-policy@0.4.0","https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-content-security-policy","MIT","# ember-cli-content-security-policy  This addon adds the `Content-Security-Policy` header to response sent from the Ember CLI Express server. Clearly, Ember CLI's express server is not intended for production use, and neither is this addon. This is intended as a tool to ensure that CSP is kept in the forefront of your thoughts while developing an Ember application.  ## Options  This addon is configured via your applications `config/environment.js` file. Two specific properties are used from your projects configuration:  * `contentSecurityPolicyHeader` -- The header to use for CSP. There are two options:   - `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` This is the default and means nothing is actually blocked but you get warnings in the console.   - `Content-Security-Policy` This makes the browser block any action that conflicts with the Content Security Policy.    The Internet Explorer variant of the header (prefixed with `X-`) is automatically added. * `contentSecurityPolicy` -- This is an object that is used to build the final header value. Each key/value   in this object is converted into a key/value pair in the resulting header value.  The default `contentSecurityPolicy` value is:  ```javascript   contentSecurityPolicy: {     'default-src': ''none'',     'script-src': ''self'',     'font-src': ''self'',     'connect-src': ''self'',     'img-src': ''self'',     'style-src': ''self'',     'media-src': ''self''   } ```  Which is translated into:  ``` default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; ```  ### Example  If your site uses **Google Fonts**, **Mixpanel**, a custom API at **custom-api.local** and a jQuery plugin which modifies the inline `style` attribute of some elements:  ```javascript // config/environment.js ENV.contentSecurityPolicy = {   'default-src': ''none'',   'script-src': ''self' https://cdn.mxpnl.com', // Allow scripts from https://cdn.mxpnl.com   'font-src': ''self' http://fonts.gstatic.com', // Allow fonts to be loaded from http://fonts.gstatic.com   'connect-src': ''self' https://api.mixpanel.com http://custom-api.local', // Allow data (ajax/websocket) from api.mixpanel.com and custom-api.local   'img-src': ''self'',   'style-src': ''self' 'unsafe-inline' http://fonts.googleapis.com', // Allow inline styles and loaded CSS from http://fonts.googleapis.com    'media-src': ''self'' } ```  More information on these options can be found at [content-security-policy.com](http://content-security-policy.com/)  *Please note*: + when running `ember serve` with live reload enabled, we also add the `liveReloadPort` to the `connect-src` and `script-src` whitelists. + when running in development we add `'unsafe-eval'` to the `script-src`. This is to allow the `wrapInEval` functionality that ember-cli does by default (as a sourcemaps 'hack'). + when setting the values on `contentSecurityPolicy` object to 'self', 'none', 'unsafe-inline','unsafe-eval','inline-script' or 'eval-script', you must include the single quote as shown in the default value above.  ## Installation  ```bash npm install --save-dev ember-cli-content-security-policy ```  ## Resources:  * http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/ * http://content-security-policy.com/ * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Using_Content_Security_Policy"

"ember-cli-less@1.3.3","https://github.com/gdub22/ember-cli-less","MIT","# ember-cli-less  Use [Less](http://lesscss.org/) to preprocess your [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) app's css.  ## Installation  ``` npm install --save-dev ember-cli-less ```  ## Usage  By default, this addon will compile `app/styles/app.less` into `dist/assets/app.css`.   Additional options can be specified using the `lessOptions` config property in `Brocfile.js`:  ```javascript var app = new EmberApp({   lessOptions: {...} }); ```  **Available Options:**   - `paths`: an array of include paths - `sourceMap`: whether to generate source maps. Defaults to `true` in development.  sourceMap can also take an object of sub options: http://lesscss.org/usage/#programmatic-usage  ## Configuring Input/Output Paths  You can configure the input and output files using ember-cli's `outputPaths` option in `Brocfile.js`: ```javascript var app = new EmberApp({   outputPaths: {     app: {       css: {         'app': '/assets/my-project.css'       }     }   } }); ```  You can also configure multiple input/output paths to generate multiple css files:  ```javascript var app = new EmberApp({   outputPaths: {     app: {       css: {         'theme-orange': '/assets/theme-orange.css',         'theme-purple': '/assets/theme-purple.css'       }     }   } }); ```  ## Usage in Addons  You can also use this to precompile less files in an addon. By default, this will compile `addon/styles/addon.less` into css that will be merged into the host app's css. *(requires ember-cli >= 0.2.0)*:  1. Install `ember-cli-less` in your addon's `package.json` under `dependencies` 2. Create your addon less file at `addon/styles/addon.less` (or where you specify in your options) 3. To run the addon's dummy app, be sure to create `tests/dummy/app/styles/app.less` if it doesn't exist  ## Examples  Using Bootstrap Less source in your app:  Install Bootstrap source:   ``` bower install --S bootstrap ```  Specify the include paths in Brocfile.js:   ```javascript var app = new EmberApp({   lessOptions: {     paths: [       'bower_components/bootstrap/less'     ]   } }); ```  Import into app.less:   ```less @import 'bootstrap'; ```  ## Linking source maps  When sourcemaps are enabled, you'll see the correct references to the original less files and their corresponding  line numbers in Dev Tools. If you would like to link the less source files directly, you have to link them to  your local filesystem in Chrome:  1. Open dev tools > Sources tab 2. Expand the sources pane on the left if it's not open 3. Right-click anywhere, _Add folder to workspace_, add your project's folder 4. Locate any less source file in the tree, right-click, _Map to Network Resource..._ to create the mapping  ## References  - Code inspired by: [ember-cli-sass](https://github.com/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass).

"ember-cli-sass@4.0.0-beta.6","https://github.com/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass","MIT","# ember-cli-sass  Use node-sass to preprocess your ember-cli app's files, with support for source maps and include paths.  ## Installation  ``` npm install --save-dev ember-cli-sass ```  ## Usage  By default this addon will compile `app/styles/app.scss` or `app/styles/app.sass` into `dist/assets/app.css` and produce  a source map for your delectation.  Or, if you want more control then you can specify options using the `sassOptions` config property in the Brocfile:  ```javascript var app = new EmberApp({   sassOptions: {...} }); ```  - `.includePaths`: an array of include paths - `.sourceMap`: controls whether to generate sourceMaps, defaults to `true` in development. The sourceMap file will be saved to `options.outputFile + '.map'` - See [broccoli-sass](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli-sass) for a list of other supported options.  ### Processing multiple files  If you need to process multiple files, it can be done by [configuring the output paths](http://www.ember-cli.com/#configuring-output-paths) in your `Brocfile.js`:  ```js var app = new EmberApp({   outputPaths: {     app: {       css: {         'app': '/assets/application-name.css',         'themes/alpha': '/assets/themes/alpha.css'       }     }   } }); ```  ### Upgrading from a previous version  In a previous versions the `sassOptions` config property was incorrectly moved to the `config/environment.js` file. This usage is deprecated, and you should specify the config in the Brocfile.  If you were using the `.inputFile` and `.outputFile` options, this is now done by [configuring the output paths](http://www.ember-cli.com/#configuring-output-paths) in your `Brocfile.js`  ## Example  The following example assumes your bower packages are installed into `bower_components/`.  Install some SASS:  ```shell bower install --save foundation ```  Specify some include paths in your Brocfile:  ```javascript var app = new EmberApp({   sassOptions = {     includePaths: [       'bower_components/foundation/scss'     ]   } }); ```  Import some deps into your app.scss:  ```scss @import 'foundation'; /* import everything */ /* or just import the bits you need: @import 'foundation/functions'; */ ```  ## Source Maps  Be aware that there are [some issues with source maps](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli-sass/issues/39) in broccoli-sass. The source maps it generates will at least show you the source file names and line number in your dev tools. When we've got a better solution in broccoli-sass you'll be able to click through to view and update the SASS files in the dev tools \o/."

One from bower `ember` and other from NPM `ember-source`. The function `forEmber` will look for `ember-source` from NPM, if it doesn't find it, it will look for `ember` in bower.  ```javascript var VersionChecker = require('ember-cli-version-checker');  module.exports = {   name: 'awesome-addon',   init: function() {     var checker = new VersionChecker(this);     var ember = checker.forEmber();      if (ember.isAbove('2.10.0')) {       /* deal with 2.10.0 stuff */     };   } }; ```"

"errno@0.1.7","https://github.com/rvagg/node-errno","MIT","# node-errno  > Better [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)/[io.js](https://iojs.org) error handling & reporting. Available in npm as *errno*.  [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)  * [errno exposed](#errnoexposed) * [Custom errors](#customerrors)  <a name='errnoexposed'></a> ## errno exposed  Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.  **By errno:**  ```js require('errno').errno[3] // → { //     'errno': 3, //     'code': 'EACCES', //     'description': 'permission denied' //   } ```  **By code:**  ```js require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY // → { //     'errno': 53, //     'code': 'ENOTEMPTY', //     'description': 'directory not empty' //   } ```  **Make your errors more descriptive:**  ```js var errno = require('errno')  function errmsg(err) {   var str = 'Error: '   // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno   if (errno.errno[err.errno])     str += errno.errno[err.errno].description   else     str += err.message    // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property   if (err.path)     str += ' [' + err.path + ']'    return str }  var fs = require('fs')  fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {   if (err)     console.log(errmsg(err)) }) ```  **Use as a command line tool:**  ``` ~ $ errno 53 {   'errno': 53,   'code': 'ENOTEMPTY',   'description': 'directory not empty' } ~ $ errno EROFS {   'errno': 56,   'code': 'EROFS',   'description': 'read-only file system' } ~ $ errno foo No such errno/code: 'foo' ```  Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.  You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.  <a name='customerrors'></a> ## Custom errors  Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.  ```js var create = require('errno').custom.createError var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)  // use them! if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')  if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err)) ```  Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:  ```js fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {   if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))   // do something else }) ```  The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.  ## Contributors  * [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI * [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)  ## Copyright & Licence  *Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*  Made available under the MIT licence:  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Esprima-FB runs on many popular web browsers, as well as other ECMAScript platforms such as [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino) and [Node.js](https://npmjs.org/package/esprima).  For more information on original Esprima, check the web site [esprima.org](http://esprima.org)."
"esprima@1.0.4","https://github.com/ariya/esprima","BSD","**Esprima** ([esprima.org](http://esprima.org)) is a high performance, standard-compliant [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) parser written in ECMAScript (also popularly known as [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>JavaScript)). Esprima is created and maintained by [Ariya Hidayat](http://twitter.com/ariyahidayat), with the help of [many contributors](https://github.com/ariya/esprima/contributors).  Esprima runs on web browsers (IE 6+, Firefox 1+, Safari 3+, Chrome 1+, Konqueror 4.6+, Opera 8+) as well as [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).  ### Features  - Full support for [ECMAScript 5.1](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)(ECMA-262) - Sensible [syntax tree format](http://esprima.org/doc/index.html#ast) compatible with Mozilla [Parser AST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API) - Heavily tested (> 550 [unit tests](http://esprima.org/test/) with solid 100% statement coverage) - Optional tracking of syntax node location (index-based and line-column) - Experimental support for ES6/Harmony (module, class, destructuring, ...)  Esprima is blazing fast (see the [benchmark suite](http://esprima.org/test/benchmarks.html)). It is up to 3x faster than UglifyJS v1 and it is still [competitive](http://esprima.org/test/compare.html) with the new generation of fast parsers.  ### Applications  Esprima serves as the basis for many popular JavaScript development tools:  - Code coverage analysis: [node-cover](https://github.com/itay/node-cover), [Istanbul](https://github.com/yahoo/Istanbul) - Documentation tool: [JFDoc](https://github.com/thejohnfreeman/jfdoc), [JSDuck](https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck) - Language extension: [LLJS](http://mbebenita.github.com/LLJS/) (low-level JS), [Sweet.js](http://sweetjs.org/) (macro) - ES6/Harmony transpiler: [Six](https://github.com/matthewrobb/six), [Harmonizr](https://github.com/jdiamond/harmonizr) - Eclipse Orion smart editing ([outline view](https://github.com/aclement/esprima-outline), [content assist](http://contraptionsforprogramming.blogspot.com/2012/02/better-javascript-content-assist-in.html)) - Source code modification: [Esmorph](https://github.com/ariya/esmorph), [Code Painter](https://github.com/fawek/codepainter), - Source transformation: [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), [Esmangle](https://github.com/Constellation/esmangle), [escodegen](https://github.com/Constellation/escodegen)  ### Questions? - [Documentation](http://esprima.org/doc) - [Issue tracker](http://issues.esprima.org): [known problems](http://code.google.com/p/esprima/issues/list?q=Defect) and [future plans](http://code.google.com/p/esprima/issues/list?q=Enhancement) - [Mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/esprima) - [Contribution guide](http://esprima.org/doc/index.html#contribution)  Follow [@Esprima](http://twitter.com/Esprima) on Twitter to get the development updates.

It was written for use in ember-cli via broccoli-sourcemap-concat.  source-map dependency ---------------------  We depend on mozilla's source-map library, but only to use their base64-vlq implementation, which is in turn based on the version in the Closure Compiler.   We can concatenate much faster than source-map because we are specifically optimized for line-by-line concatenation."

It does not provide a server itself, but rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing [Node](http://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction other than the standard [WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).  It also provides an abstraction for handling [EventSource](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) connections, which are one-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They are based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies than WebSockets.   ## Installation  ``` $ npm install faye-websocket ```   ## Handling WebSocket connections in Node  You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this is how you'd implement an echo server:  ```js var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),     http      = require('http');  var server = http.createServer();  server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {   if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {     var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);          ws.on('message', function(event) {       ws.send(event.data);     });          ws.on('close', function(event) {       console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);       ws = null;     });   } });  server.listen(8000); ```  `WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the `ws.on('message', ...)` line with:  ```js     ws.pipe(ws); ```  Note that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting through an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you call `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire handshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer the message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any buffered messages will be sent to the client.  If you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the `onopen` event.  If the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to send a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a message string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message is received. It returns `true` iff a ping message was sent. If the client does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns `false`.  ```js ws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {   // fires when pong is received }); ```   ## Using the WebSocket client  The client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss` protocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web browser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.  ```js var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),     ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');  ws.on('open', function(event) {   console.log('open');   ws.send('Hello, world!'); });  ws.on('message', function(event) {   console.log('message', event.data); });  ws.on('close', function(event) {   console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);   ws = null; }); ```  The WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the handshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.   ## Subprotocol negotiation  The WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application protocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which protocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you construct the socket:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']); ```  On the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server supports after the other constructor arguments:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']); ```  If the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side socket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.   ## Initialization options  Both the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in at initialization time, for example:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options); var ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options); ```  `protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`. `options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:  * `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to   be sent during the handshake process * `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.   The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB. * `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping   frames, measured in seconds   ## WebSocket API  Both server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.  * <b>`on('open', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket connection is   established. Event has no attributes. * <b>`on('message', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket receives a   message. Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`   (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames). * <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error   due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,   you do not need to implement error recover. * <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the   server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes,   <b>`code`</b> and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message   sent by the peer that closed the connection. * <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a   text or binary message over the connection to the other peer. * <b>`ping(message = '', function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an   optional message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received. * <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status   code and reason text, both of which are optional. * <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`   protocol the connection is using. * <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the   subprotocol the socket is using.   ## Handling EventSource connections in Node  EventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they only allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API. EventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each message has an optional event-type and ID.  ```js var WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),     EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,     http        = require('http');  var server = http.createServer();  server.on('request', function(request, response) {   if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {     var es = new EventSource(request, response);     console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);          // Periodically send messages     var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);          es.on('close', function() {       clearInterval(loop);       es = null;     });      } else {     // Normal HTTP request     response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});     response.end('Hello');   } });  server.listen(8000); ```  The `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default event-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification` event with ID `99`:  ```js es.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'}); ```  The `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:  * <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the   EventSource. * <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the   client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped   connection to determine which messages need resending.  When you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass configuration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:  * <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the   EventSource response. * <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it   should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect. * <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to   send 'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat   timeouts set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.  For example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings every 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:  ```js var es = new EventSource(request, response, {   headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},   ping:    15,   retry:   10 }); ```  You can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike WebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.   ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2010-2013 James Coglan  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"fb-watchman@2.0.0","https://github.com/facebook/watchman","Apache-2.0","# fb-watchman  `fb-watchman` is a filesystem watcher that uses the [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) file watching service from Facebook.  Watchman provides file change notification services using very efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and filesystem tree querying operations using [a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).  ## Install  You should [install Watchman]( https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this module.  Then simply:  ``` $ npm install fb-watchman ```  ## Key Concepts  - Watchman recursively watches directories. - Each watched directory is called a `root`. - You must initiate a `watch` on a `root` using the `watch-project` command prior to subscribing to changes - Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, `watch-project` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your `.watchmanconfig` or source control repository root) - change notifications are relative to the project root  ## How do I use it?  [Read the NodeJS watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/nodejs.html)"

"fireworm@0.6.6","https://github.com/airportyh/fireworm","MIT","Fireworm ========  <img src='https://api.travis-ci.org/airportyh/fireworm.png'>  Fireworm is a crawling file watcher.  ## Install      npm install fireworm  ## Usage  ``` js var fireworm = require('fireworm')  // make a new file watcher var fw = fireworm('start_dir')  // Add the files you want to watch for changes on (can be glob) fw.add('lib/**/*.js') fw.add('tests/**/*.js')  // ignore some patterns fw.ignore('tests/dontcare/*.js')  // register for the `change` event fw.on('change', function(filename){     console.log(filename + ' just changed!') }) ```  ## How is this different from other file watchers?  Fireworm works by crawling and re-crawling the relevant directories when necessary. Because of this, it can detect newly created files, new files in newly created directories, re-created files, and even new files within re-created directories too - as long as the file matches the paths you are watching.  As of version 0.5.2, fireworm uses `fs.watch` to watch directories only.  ## API  ### Constructor  `fireworm(dir, [options])` - returns a file watcher object for files within `dir`.  Options:  * `ignoreInitial:boolean` (default `false`) - do not fire `add` events when encountering files or directory for the initial time it is crawled. * `skipDirEntryPatterns:array` (default `['node_modules', '.*']`) - when crawling directories, skip the directory entries which match these glob patterns.  ### File Watcher Object  ### Methods  * `add(filepath:string|array)` - add these file patterns (glob) to the watch list. The parameter(s) can be a variable number of strings or arrays of strings. * `ignore(filepath:string|array)` - add these file patterns (glob) to the ignore list. The parameter(s) can be a variable number of strings or arrays of strings. * `clear()` - clear all previously added match patterns or ignore patterns.  ### Events  File watcher objects are [EventEmitters](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter), and can emit these events:  * `add` - fired when a matching file has been added to the FS. Parameter: `path` - the path to the file * `change` - fired when a matching file has been modified. Parameter: `path` - the path to the file * `remove` - fired when a matching file has been removed from the FS. Parameter: `path` - the path to the file  ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2013 Toby Ho &lt;airportyh@gmail.com&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"fs-tree-diff@0.3.1","","MIT","# fs-tree-diff [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/fs-tree-diff.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/fs-tree-diff)  FSTree provides the means to calculate a patch (set of operations) between one file system tree and another.  The possible operations are:  * `unlink` – remove the specified file * `rmdir` – remove the specified folder * `mkdir` – create the specified folder * `create` – create the specified file * `update` – update the specified file  The operations choosen aim to minimize the amount of IO required to apply a given patch. For example, a naive `rm -rf` of a directory tree is actually quite costly, as child directories must be recursively traversed, entries stated.. etc, all to figure out what first must be deleted. Since we patch from tree to tree, discovering new files is both wasteful and un-needed.  The operations will also be provided in the correct order. So when deleting a large tree, unlink and rmdir operations will be provided depthFirst. Allowing us to safely replay the operations without having to first confirm the FS is as we expected.  A simple example:  ```js var FSTree = require('fs-tree-diff'); var current = FSTree.fromPaths([   'a.js' ]);  var next = FSTree.fromPaths({   'b.js' });  current.calculatePatch(next) === [   ['unlink', 'a.js'],   ['create', 'b.js'] ]; ```  A slightly more complicated example:  ```js var FSTree = require('fs-tree-diff'); var current = FSTree.fromPaths([   'a.js',   'b/f.js' ]);  var next = FSTree.fromPaths({   'b.js',   'b/c/d.js'   'b/e.js' });  current.calculatePatch(next) === [   ['unlink', 'a.js'],   ['unlink', 'b/f.js'],   ['create', 'b.js'],   ['mkdir', 'b/c'],   ['create', 'b/c/d.js'],   ['create', 'b/e.js'] ]; ```  Now, the above examples do not demonstrate `update` operations. This is because when providing only paths, we do not have sufficient information to check if one entry is merely different from another with the same relativePath.  For this, FSTree supports more complex input structure. To demonstrate, We will use the [walk-sync](https://github.com/joliss/node-walk-sync) module. Which provides higher fidelity input, allowing FSTree to also detect changes. More on what an [entry from walkSync.entries is](https://github.com/joliss/node-walk-sync#entries)  ```js var walkSync = require('walk-sync');  // path/to/root/foo.js // path/to/root/bar.js var current = new FSTree({   entries: walkSync.entries('path/to/root') });  writeFileSync('path/to/root/foo.js', 'new content'); writeFileSync('path/to/root/baz.js', 'new file');  var next = new FSTree({   entries: walkSync.entries('path/to/root') });  current.calculatePatch(next) === [   ['update', 'foo.js'], // mtime + size changed, so this input is stale and needs updating.

The possible operations are:  * `unlink` – remove the specified file * `rmdir` – remove the specified folder * `mkdir` – create the specified folder * `create` – create the specified file * `change` – update the specified file to reflect changes  The operations chosen aim to minimize the amount of IO required to apply a given patch. For example, a naive `rm -rf` of a directory tree is actually quite costly, as child directories must be recursively traversed, entries stated.. etc, all to figure out what first must be deleted. Since we patch from tree to tree, discovering new files is both wasteful and un-needed.  The operations will also be provided in a correct order, allowing us to safely replay operations without having to first confirm the FS is as we expect.  For example, `unlink`s for files will occur before a `rmdir` of those files' parent dir.  Although the ordering will be safe, a specific order is not guaranteed.  A simple example:  ```js var FSTree = require('fs-tree-diff'); var current = FSTree.fromPaths([   'a.js' ]);  var next = FSTree.fromPaths([   'b.js' ]);  current.calculatePatch(next) === [   ['unlink', 'a.js', entryA],   ['create', 'b.js', entryB] ]; ```  A slightly more complicated example:  ```js var FSTree = require('fs-tree-diff'); var current = FSTree.fromPaths([   'a.js',   'b/',   'b/f.js' ]);  var next = FSTree.fromPaths([   'b.js',   'b/',   'b/c/',   'b/c/d.js',   'b/e.js' ]);  current.calculatePatch(next) === [   ['unlink', 'a.js', entryA],   ['create', 'b.js', entryB],   ['mkdir', 'b/c', entryBC],   ['create', 'b/c/d.js', entryBCD],   ['create', 'b/e.js', entryBE]   ['unlink', 'b/f.js', entryBF], ] ```  Now, the above examples do not demonstrate `change` operations. This is because when providing only paths, we do not have sufficient information to check if one entry is merely different from another with the same relativePath.  For this, FSTree supports more complex input structure. To demonstrate, we will use the [walk-sync](https://github.com/joliss/node-walk-sync) module, which provides higher fidelity input, allowing FSTree to also detect changes. (See also the documentation for [walkSync.entries](https://github.com/joliss/node-walk-sync#entries).)  ```js var walkSync = require('walk-sync');  // path/to/root/foo.js // path/to/root/bar.js var current = new FSTree({   entries: walkSync.entries('path/to/root') });  writeFileSync('path/to/root/foo.js', 'new content'); writeFileSync('path/to/root/baz.js', 'new file');  var next = new FSTree({   entries: walkSync.entries('path/to/root') });  current.calculatePatch(next) === [   ['change', 'foo.js', entryFoo], // mtime + size changed, so this input is stale and needs updating.   ['create', 'baz.js', entryBaz]  // new file, so we should create it   /* bar stays the same and is left inert*/ ]; ```  The entry objects provided depend on the operation.  For `rmdir` and `unlink` operations, the current entry is provided.  For `mkdir`, `change` and `create` operations the new entry is provided.  ## API  The public API is:  - `FSTree.fromPaths` initialize a tree from an array of string paths. - `FSTree.fromEntries` initialize a tree from an array of `Entry` objects.   Each entry must have the following properties (but may have more):      - `relativePath`     - `mode`     - `size`     - `mtime` - `FSTree.applyPatch(inputDir, outputDir, patch, delegate)` applies the given   patch from the input directory to the output directory. You can optionally   provide a delegate object to handle individual types of patch operations. - `FSTree.prototype.calculatePatch(newTree, isEqual)` calculate a patch against   `newTree`.  Optionally specify a custom `isEqual` (see Change Calculation). - `FSTree.prototype.calculateAndApplyPatch(newTree, inputDir, outputDir, delegate)`   does a `calculatePatch` followed by `applyPatch`. - `FSTree.prototype.addEntries(entries, options)` adds entries to an   existing tree. Options are the same as for `FSTree.fromEntries`.   Entries added with the same path will overwrite any existing entries. - `FSTree.prototype.addPaths(paths, options)` adds paths to an   existing tree. Options are the same as for `FSTree.fromPaths`.   If entries already exist for any of the paths added, those entries will   be updated. - `Entry.fromStat(relativePath, stat)` creates an `Entry` from a given path and   [`fs.Stats`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object. It can   then be used with `fromEntries` or `addEntries`.   The trees returned from `fromPaths` and `fromEntries` are relative to some base directory.  `calculatePatch`, `applyPatch` and `calculateAndApplyPatch` all assume that the base directory has not changed.  ## Input  `FSTree.fromPaths`, `FSTree.fromEntries`, `FSTree.prototype.addPaths`, and `FSTree.prototype.addEntries` all validate their inputs.  Inputs must be sorted, path-unique (i.e. two entries with the same `relativePath` but different `size`s would still be illegal input) and include intermediate directories.  For example, the following input is **invalid**  ```js FSTree.fromPaths([   // => missing a/ and a/b/   'a/b/c.js' ]); ```  To have FSTree sort and expand (include intermediate directories) for you, add the option `sortAndExpand`).  ```js FStree.fromPaths([ 	'a/b/q/r/bar.js', 	'a/b/c/d/foo.js', ], { sortAndExpand: true });  // The above is equivalent to  FSTree.fromPaths([ 	'a/', 	'a/b/', 	'a/b/c/', 	'a/b/c/d/', 	'a/b/c/d/foo.js', 	'a/b/q/', 	'a/b/q/r/', 	'a/b/q/r/bar.js', ]); ```  ## Entry  `FSTree.fromEntries` requires you to supply your own `Entry` objects.  Your entry objects **must** contain the following properties:    - `relativePath`   - `mode`   - `size`   - `mtime`  They must also implement the following API:    - `isDirectory()` `true` *iff* this entry is a directory  `FSTree.fromEntries` composes well with the output of `walkSync.entries`:  ```js var walkSync = require('walk-sync');  // path/to/root/foo.js // path/to/root/bar.js var current = FSTree.fromEntries(walkSync.entries('path/to/root')); ```  ## Change Calculation  When a prior entry has a `relativePath` that matches that of a current entry, a change operation is included if the new entry is different from the previous entry.  This is determined by calling `isEqual`, the optional second argument to `calculatePatch`.  If no `isEqual` is provided, a default `isEqual` is used.  The default `isEqual` treats directories as always equal and files as different if any of the following properties have changed.    - `mode`   - `size`   - `mtime`  User specified `isEqual` will often want to use the default `isEqual`, so it is exported on `FSTree`.  Example  ```js var defaultIsEqual = FSTtreeDiff.isEqual;  function isEqualCheckingMeta(a, b) {   return defaultIsEqual(a, b) && isMetaEqual(a, b); }  function isMetaEqual(a, b) {   // ... } ```  ## Patch Application  When you want to apply changes from one tree to another easily, you can use the `FSTree.applyPatch` method. For example, given:  ```js var patch = oldInputTree.calculatePatch(newInputTree); var inputDir = 'src'; var outputDir = 'dist'; FSTree.applyPatch(inputDir, outputDir, patch); ```  It will apply the patch changes to `dist` while using `src` as a reference for non-destructive operations (`mkdir`, `create`, `change`). If you want to calculate and apply a patch without any intermediate operations, you can do:  ```js var inputDir = 'src'; var outputDir = 'dist'; oldInputTree.calculateAndApplyPatch(newInputTree, inputDir, outputDir); ```  You can optionally provide a delegate object to handle applying specific types of operations:  ```js var createCount = 0; FSTree.applyPatch(inputDir, outputDir, patch, {   create: function(inputPath, outputPath, relativePath) {     createCount++;     copy(inputPath, outputPath);   } }); ```  The available delegate functions are the same as the supported operations: `unlink`, `rmdir`, `mkdir`, `create`, and `change`. Each delegate function receives the reference `inputPath`, the `outputPath`, and `relativePath` of the file or directory for which to apply the operation."

"heimdalljs@0.2.5","https://github.com/heimdalljs/heimdalljs-lib","MIT","![build status](https://travis-ci.org/heimdalljs/heimdalljs-lib.svg)  ## Global Session  Heimdall tracks a graph of timing and domain-specific stats for performance. Stat collection and monitoring is separated from graph construction to provide control over context detail.  Users can create fewer nodes to have reduced performance overhead, or create more nodes to provide more detail.  The graph obviously needs to be global.  This is not a problem in the browser, but in node we may have multiple different versions of heimdalljs loaded at once.  Each one will have its own `Heimdall` instance, but will use the same session, saved on `process`.  This means that the session will have a heterogeneous graph of `HeimdallNode`s.  For this reason, versions of heimdalljs that change `Session`, or the APIs of `HeimdallNode` or `Cookie` will use a different property to store their session (`process._heimdall_session_<n>`).  It is quite easy for this to result in lost detail & lost stats, although it is also easy to detect this situation and issue a warning.  ## API  ### Heimdall  ### Creating a Heimdall instance  `require('heimdalljs')` to access an instance using the globally shared session.  You can create your own instance with its own session, but this is generally reommended only for testing.  ```js var Heimdall = require('heimdalljs/heimdall'); // this will create its own session and not use the global session var myInstance = new Heimdall(); ```  #### Properties  - `heimdall.current` Return the leaf `HeimdallNode` of the currently active nodes. - `heimdall.root` Return the root `HeimdallNode`  #### Functions  - `heimdall.start(id, Schema)` Create a new node with id `id`.  This node becomes the   active node.  Its parent is the currently active node.  Return this node's   `Cookie`. - `heimdall.node(id, [Schema], callback, [context])` Create a new node, invoke   `callback` passing in the newly created node's `stats` object and then stop   the node. - `registerMonitor(name, Schema)` register a monitor under namespace `name`.  An   error will be thrown if the reserved names `own` or `time` are used, or if a   monitor with that name has already been registered for this session. - `statsFor(name)` return the stats object for the monitor under namespace   `name`. - `configFor(name)` return the config object under `name`.  Heimdall does not do   anything with these config objects: it is a place for downstream consumers to   share config across a heimdall session (see eg   [heimdalljs-logger](https://github.com/heimdalljs/heimdalljs-logger)). - `toJSON()` return the json for the entire graph.  This is intended to be   written via `JSON.stringify` and then consumed by downstream apps (see eg   [broccoli-viz](https://github.com/stefanpenner/broccoli-viz)). - `visitPreOrder(callback)` sugar for `root.visitPreOrder(callback)` - `visitPostOrder(callback)` sugar for `root.visitPostOrder(callback)`   ### HeimdallNode  #### Identifiers  #### Properties  - `isRoot` returns true for the root node, and false for all other nodes.  #### Functions  - `visitPreOrder(callback)` visit the subtree rooted at this node with a   depth-first pre-order traversal. - `visitPostOrder(callback)` visit the subtree rooted at this node with a   depth-first post-order traversal. - `forEachChild(callback)` invoke `callback` for each child of this node (but   not other descendants). - `remove` remove this node from its parent.  May only be called on an inactive,   non-root node.  Intended for long-running applications to free up memory after   saving a subgraph via `toJSONSubgraph`. - `toJSON()` Return the serialized representation of this ndoe. - `toJSONSubgraph()` Return the serialized representation of the subtree rooted at   this node.  ### Cookie  #### Functions  - `stop()` stop the node associated with this cookie.  May only be called on the   current node. - `resume()` resume a stopped node.  This is useful for nodes that are restarted   asynchronously.  ## Example Usage  ### Simple  ```js var heimdall = require('heimdall');  function BroccoliNodeSchema() {   this.builds = 0; }   heimdall.node('broccoli', function () {   heimdall.node('node:babel', BroccoliNodeSchema, function (h) {     h.builds++;      heimdall.node('node:persistent-filter', BroccoliNodeSchema, function (h) {       h.builds++;     });      heimdall.node('node:caching-writer', BroccoliNodeSchema, function (h) {       h.builds++;     });   }); });  ```  ```json {   'nodes': [{     'id': 0,     'name': 'broccoli',     'stats': {       'cpu': {         'self': 10,       },     },     'children': {       'start': [1],       'end': [1],     },   }, {     'id': 1,     'name': 'node:babel',     'stats': {       'builds': 1,       'cpu': {         'self': 20,       },     },     'children': {       'start': [2, 3],       'end': [2, 3],     },   }, {     'id': 2,     'name': 'node:persistent-filter',     'stats': {       'builds': 1,       'cpu': {         'self': 30,       },     },   }, {     'id': 3,     'name': 'node:caching-writer',     'stats': {       'builds': 1,       'cpu': {         'self': 40,       },     },   }], } ```  ### With Monitors  ```js var heimdall = require('heimdall'); var fs = require('fs');  var origLstatSync = fs.lstatSync; var origMkdirSync = fs.mkdirSync;  heimdall.registerMonitor('fs', function FSSchema() {   this.lstatCount = 0;   this.mkdirCount = 0; });  fs.lstatSync = function () {   heimdall.statsFor('fs').lstatCount++;   return origLstatSync.apply(fs, arguments); }  fs.mkdirSync = function () {   heimdall.statsFor('fs').mkdirCount++;   return origMkdirSync.apply(fs, arguments); }   function BroccoliNodeSchema() {   this.builds = 0; }   heimdall.node('broccoli', function () {   heimdall.node('node:babel', BroccoliNodeSchema, function (h) {     h.builds++;      heimdall.node('node:persistent-filter', BroccoliNodeSchema, function (h) {       h.builds++;       fs.mkdirSync('./tmp');     });      heimdall.node('node:caching-writer', BroccoliNodeSchema, function (h) {       h.builds++;       fs.lstatSync('./tmp');     });   }); });  ```  ```json {   'nodes': [{     'id': 0,     'name': 'broccoli',     'stats': {       'cpu': {         'self': 10,       },       'fs': {         'lstatCount': 0,         'mkdirCount': 0,       },     },     'children': {       'start': [1],       'end': [1],     },   }, {     'id': 1,     'name': 'node:babel',     'stats': {       'builds': 1,       'cpu': {         'self': 20,       },       'fs': {         'lstatCount': 0,         'mkdirCount': 0,       },     },     'children': {       'start': [2, 3],       'end': [2, 3],     },   }, {     'id': 2,     'name': 'node:persistent-filter',     'stats': {       'builds': 1,       'cpu': {         'self': 30,       },       'fs': {         'lstatCount': 0,         'mkdirCount': 1,       },     },   }, {     'id': 3,     'name': 'node:caching-writer',     'stats': {       'builds': 1,       'cpu': {         'self': 40,       },       'fs': {         'lstatCount': 1,         'mkdirCount': 0,       },     },   }], } ```"

"insight@0.5.3","https://github.com/yeoman/insight","BSD*","# Insight [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/insight.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/insight)  > Understand how your tool is being used by anonymously reporting usage metrics to [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) or [Yandex.Metrica](http://metrica.yandex.com/)   ## Access data / generate dashboards  ### Google Analytics (GA)  - Use [Embed API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/) to embed charts - Use [Core Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/) or [Real Time Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/realtime/v3/) to access raw data, then build custom visualization, e.g. [metrics from Bower](http://bower.io/stats/) - Use GA's dashboards directly, e.g. metrics from [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io):  ![analytics screenshot](screenshot-ga-dashboard.png)   ## Provider Setup  ### Google Analytics (GA)  Currently Insight should to be used with GA set up as web tracking due to use of URLs. Future plan include refactoring to work with GA set up for app-based tracking and the [Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/).  For debugging, Insight can track OS version, node version and version of the app that implements Insight. Please set up custom dimensions per below screenshot. This is a temporary solution until Insight is refactored into app-based tracking.  ![GA custom dimensions screenshot](screenshot-ga-custom-dimensions.png)   ## Collected Data  Insight cares deeply about the security of your user's data, and strives to be fully transparent with what it tracks. All data is sent via HTTPS secure connections. Insight provides API to offer an easy way for users to opt-out at any time.  Below is what Insight is capable of tracking. Individual implementation can choose to not track some items.  - The version of the module that implements Insight - Module commands (e.g. install / search) - Name and version of packages involved with command used - Version of node.js & OS for developer debugging - A random & absolutely anonymous ID   ## Usage  ### Google Analytics  ```js var Insight = require('insight'); var pkg = require('./package.json');  var insight = new Insight({ 	// Google Analytics tracking code 	trackingCode: 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X', 	pkg: pkg });  // ask for permission the first time if (insight.optOut === undefined) { 	return insight.askPermission(); }  insight.track('foo', 'bar'); // recorded in Analytics as `/foo/bar` ```  ### Yandex.Metrica  ```js var Insight = require('insight'); var pkg = require('./package.json');  var insight = new Insight({ 	// Yandex.Metrica counter id 	trackingCode: 'XXXXXXXXX' 	trackingProvider: 'yandex', 	pkg: pkg });  // ask for permission the first time if (insight.optOut === undefined) { 	return insight.askPermission(); }  insight.track('foo', 'bar'); // recorded in Yandex.Metrica as `http://<package-name>.insight/foo/bar` ```  or a [live example](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman)   ## API  ### Insight(settings)  #### trackingCode  **Required**   Type: `string`  Your Google Analytics [trackingCode](https://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1008080) or Yandex.Metrica [counter id](http://help.yandex.com/metrika/?id=1121963).  #### trackingProvider  Type: `string`   Default: `'google'` Values: `'google'`, `'yandex'`  Tracking provider to use.  #### pkg  ##### name  **Required**   Type: `string`  ##### version  Type: `string`   Default: `'undefined'`  #### config  Type: `object`   Default: An instance of [`configstore`](https://github.com/yeoman/configstore)  If you want to use your own configuration mechanism instead of the default `configstore`-based one, you can provide an object that has to implement two synchronous methods:  - `get(key)` - `set(key, value)`   ### Instance methods  #### .track(keyword, [keyword, ...])  Accepts keywords which ends up as a path in Analytics.  `.track('init', 'backbone')` becomes `/init/backbone`  #### .askPermission([message, callback])  Asks the user permission to opt-in to tracking and sets the `optOut` property in `config`. You can also choose to set `optOut` property in `config` manually.  ![askPermission screenshot](screenshot-askpermission.png)  Optionally supply your own `message` and `callback`. If `message` is `null`, default message will be used. The callback will be called with the arguments `error` and `optIn` when the prompt is done, and is useful for when you want to continue the execution while the prompt is running.   #### .optOut  Returns a boolean whether the user has opted out of tracking. Should preferably only be set by a user action, eg. a prompt.   ## License  [BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) and copyright Google"

"jju@1.2.0","https://github.com/rlidwka/jju","WTFPL","`jju` - a set of utilities to work with JSON / JSON5 documents  [![npm version badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/jju.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jju) [![travis badge](http://img.shields.io/travis/rlidwka/jju.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rlidwka/jju) [![downloads badge](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/jju.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jju)  ## Installation  ``` npm install jju ```  ## Usage  This module provides following functions:  1. [jju.parse()](#jjuparse-function) parses json/json5 text and returns a javascript value it corresponds to 2. [jju.stringify()](#jjustringify-function) converts javascript value to an appropriate json/json5 text 3. [jju.tokenize()](#jjutokenize-function) parses json/json5 text and returns an array of tokens it consists of ([see demo](http://rlidwka.github.io/jju/tokenizer.html)) 4. [jju.analyze()](#jjuanalyze-function) parses json/json5 text and tries to guess indentation, quoting style, etc. 5. [jju.update()](#jjuupdate-function) changes json/json5 text, preserving original formatting as much as possible ([see demo](http://rlidwka.github.io/jju/editor.html))  All functions are able to work with a standard JSON documents. `jju.parse()` and `jju.stringify()` are better in some cases, but slower than native `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` versions. Detailed description see below.  ### jju.parse() function  ```javascript /*  * Main syntax:  *  * `text` - text to parse, type: String  * `options` - parser options, type: Object  */ jju.parse(text[, options])  // compatibility syntax jju.parse(text[, reviver]) ```  Options:   - reserved\_keys - what to do with reserved keys (String, default='ignore')    - 'ignore' - ignore reserved keys    - 'throw' - throw SyntaxError in case of reserved keys    - 'replace' - replace reserved keys, this is the default JSON.parse behaviour, unsafe       Reserved keys are keys that exist in an empty object (`hasOwnProperty`, `__proto__`, etc.).  ```javascript // 'ignore' will cause reserved keys to be ignored: parse('{hasOwnProperty: 1}', {reserved_keys: 'ignore'}) == {} parse('{hasOwnProperty: 1, x: 2}', {reserved_keys: 'ignore'}).hasOwnProperty('x') == true  // 'throw' will cause SyntaxError in these cases: parse('{hasOwnProperty: 1}', {reserved_keys: 'throw'}) == SyntaxError  // 'replace' will replace reserved keys with new ones: parse('{hasOwnProperty: 1}', {reserved_keys: 'throw'}) == {hasOwnProperty: 1} parse('{hasOwnProperty: 1, x: 2}', {reserved_keys: 'ignore'}).hasOwnProperty('x') == TypeError ```    - null\_prototype - create object as Object.create(null) instead of '{}' (Boolean)     if `reserved_keys != 'replace'`, default is **false**     if `reserved_keys == 'replace'`, default is **true**     It is usually unsafe and not recommended to change this option to false in the last case.   - reviver - reviver function - Function     This function should follow JSON specification   - mode - operation mode, set it to 'json' if you want to throw on non-strict json files (String)  ### jju.stringify() function  ```javascript /*  * Main syntax:  *  * `value` - value to serialize, type: *  * `options` - serializer options, type: Object  */ jju.stringify(value[, options])  // compatibility syntax jju.stringify(value[, replacer [, indent]) ```  Options:   - ascii - output ascii only (Boolean, default=false)    If this option is enabled, output will not have any characters except of 0x20-0x7f.   - indent - indentation (String, Number or Boolean, default='\t')    This option follows JSON specification.   - quote - enquoting char (String, ''' or ''', default=''')  - quote\_keys - whether keys quoting in objects is required or not (String, default=false)    If you want `{'q': 1}` instead of `{q: 1}`, set it to true.   - sort\_keys - sort all keys while stringifying (Boolean or Function, default=false)    By default sort order will depend on implementation, with v8 it's insertion order. If set to `true`, all keys (but not arrays) will be sorted alphabetically. You can provide your own sorting function as well.   - replacer - replacer function or array (Function or Array)    This option follows JSON specification.   - no\_trailing\_comma = don't output trailing comma (Boolean, default=false)    If this option is set, arrays like this `[1,2,3,]` will never be generated. Otherwise they may be generated for pretty printing.   - mode - operation mode, set it to 'json' if you want correct json in the output (String)     Currently it's either 'json' or something else. If it is 'json', following options are implied:     - options.quote = '''    - options.no\_trailing\_comma = true    - options.quote\_keys = true    - '\x' literals are not used  ### jju.tokenize() function  ```javascript /*  * Main syntax:  *  * `text` - text to tokenize, type: String  * `options` - parser options, type: Object  */ jju.tokenize(text[, options]) ```  Options are the same as for the `jju.parse` function.  Return value is an array of tokens, where each token is an object:   - raw (String) - raw text of this token, if you join all raw's, you will get the original document  - type (String) - type of the token, can be `whitespace`, `comment`, `key`, `literal`, `separator` or `newline`  - stack (Array) - path to the current token in the syntax tree  - value - value of the token if token is a `key` or `literal`  You can check tokenizer for yourself using [this demo](http://rlidwka.github.io/jju/tokenizer.html).  ### jju.analyze() function  ```javascript /*  * Main syntax:  *  * `text` - text to analyze, type: String  * `options` - parser options, type: Object  */ jju.analyze(text[, options]) ```  Options are the same as for the `jju.parse` function.  Return value is an object defining a programming style in which the document was written.   - indent (String) - preferred indentation  - newline (String) - preferred newline  - quote (String) - `'` or `'` depending on which quote is preferred  - quote\_keys (Boolean) - `true` if unquoted keys were used at least once  - has\_whitespace (Boolean) - `true` if input has a whitespace token  - has\_comments (Boolean) - `true` if input has a comment token  - has\_newlines (Boolean) - `true` if input has a newline token  - has\_trailing\_comma (Boolean) - `true` if input has at least one trailing comma  ### jju.update() function  ```javascript /*  * Main syntax:  *  * `text` - original text, type: String  * `new_value` - new value you want to set  * `options` - parser or stringifier options, type: Object  */ jju.update(text, new_value[, options]) ```  If you want to update a JSON document, here is the general approach:  ```javascript // here is your original JSON document: var input = '{'foo': 'bar', 'baz': 123}'  // you need to parse it first: var json = jju.parse(input, {mode: 'json'}) // json is { foo: 'bar', baz: 123 }  // then you can change it as you like: json.foo = 'quux' json.hello = 'world'  // then you run an update function to change the original json: var output = jju.update(input, json, {mode: 'json'}) // output is '{'foo': 'quux', 'baz': 123, 'hello': 'world'}' ```  Look at [this demo](http://rlidwka.github.io/jju/editor.html) to test various types of json.  ## Advantages over existing JSON libraries  In a few cases it makes sense to use this module instead of built-in JSON methods.  Parser:  - better error reporting with source code and line numbers  In case of syntax error, JSON.parse does not return any good information to the user. This module does:  ``` $ node -e 'require('jju').parse('[1,1,1,1,invalid]')'  SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'i' at 0:9 [1,1,1,1,invalid]          ^ ```  This module is about 5 times slower, so if user experience matters to you more than performance, use this module. If you're working with a lot of machine-generated data, use JSON.parse instead.  Stringifier:  - util.inspect-like pretty printing  This module behaves more smart when dealing with object and arrays, and does not always print newlines in them:  ``` $ node -e 'console.log(require('./').stringify([[,,,],,,[,,,,]], {mode:'json'}))' [         [null, null, null],         null,         null,         [null, null, null, null] ] ```  JSON.stringify will split this into 15 lines, and it's hard to read.  Yet again, this feature comes with a performance hit, so if user experience matters to you more than performance, use this module. If your JSON will be consumed by machines, use JSON.stringify instead.  As a rule of thumb, if you use 'space' argument to indent your JSON, you'd better use this module instead."

"json5@0.4.0","https://github.com/aseemk/json5","MIT","[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aseemk/json5.png)](https://travis-ci.org/aseemk/json5)   # JSON5 – Modern JSON  JSON is an excellent data format, but we think it can be better.  **JSON5 is a proposed extension to JSON** that aims to make it easier for *humans to write and maintain* by hand. It does this by adding some minimal syntax features directly from ECMAScript 5.  JSON5 remains a **strict subset of JavaScript**, adds **no new data types**, and **works with all existing JSON content**.  JSON5 is *not* an official successor to JSON, and JSON5 content may *not* work with existing JSON parsers. For this reason, JSON5 files use a new .json5 extension. *(TODO: new MIME type needed too.)*  The code here is a **reference JavaScript implementation** for both Node.js and all browsers. It's based directly off of Douglas Crockford's own [JSON implementation][json_parse.js], and it's both robust and secure.   ## Why  JSON isn't the friendliest to *write*. Keys need to be quoted, objects and arrays can't have trailing commas, and comments aren't allowed — even though none of these are the case with regular JavaScript today.  That was fine when JSON's goal was to be a great data format, but JSON's usage has expanded beyond *machines*. JSON is now used for writing [configs][ex1], [manifests][ex2], even [tests][ex3] — all by *humans*.  [ex1]: http://plovr.com/docs.html [ex2]: http://npmjs.org/doc/json.html [ex3]: http://code.google.com/p/fuzztester/wiki/JSONFileFormat  There are other formats that are human-friendlier, like YAML, but changing from JSON to a completely different format is undesirable in many cases. JSON5’s aim is to remain close to JSON and JavaScript.   ## Features  The following is the exact list of additions to JSON's syntax introduced by JSON5. **All of these are optional**, and **all of these come from ES5**.  ### Objects  - Object keys can be unquoted if they're valid [identifiers][mdn_variables].   Yes, even reserved keywords (like `default`) are valid unquoted keys in ES5   [[§11.1.5](http://es5.github.com/#x11.1.5), [§7.6](http://es5.github.com/#x7.6)].    *(TODO: Unicode characters and escape sequences aren’t yet supported in this   implementation.)*  - Objects can have trailing commas.  [mdn_variables]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Core_Language_Features#Variables  ### Arrays  - Arrays can have trailing commas.  ### Strings  - Strings can be single-quoted.  - Strings can be split across multiple lines; just prefix each newline with a   backslash. [ES5 [§7.8.4](http://es5.github.com/#x7.8.4)]  ### Numbers  - Numbers can be hexadecimal (base 16). (But note that neither signed   hexadecimals nor hexadecimal floats are allowed by ES5.)  - Numbers can begin or end with a (leading or trailing) decimal point.  - Numbers can include `Infinity` and `-Infinity`.  - Numbers can begin with an explicit plus sign.  ### Comments  - Both inline (single-line) and block (multi-line) comments are allowed.   ## Example  The following is a contrived example, but it illustrates most of the features:  ```js {     foo: 'bar',     while: true,      this: 'is a \ multi-line string',      // this is an inline comment     here: 'is another', // inline comment      /* this is a block comment        that continues on another line */      hex: 0xDEADbeef,     half: .5,     delta: +10,     to: Infinity,   // and beyond!      finally: 'a trailing comma',     oh: [         'we shouldn't forget',         'arrays can have',         'trailing commas too',     ], } ```  This implementation's own [package.json5](package.json5) is more realistic:  ```js // This file is written in JSON5 syntax, naturally, but npm needs a regular // JSON file, so compile via `npm run build`. Be sure to keep both in sync!  {     name: 'json5',     version: '0.2.0',     description: 'JSON for the ES5 era.',     keywords: ['json', 'es5'],     author: 'Aseem Kishore <aseem.kishore@gmail.com>',     contributors: [         'Max Nanasy <max.nanasy@gmail.com>',     ],     main: 'lib/json5.js',     bin: 'lib/cli.js',     dependencies: {},     devDependencies: {         mocha: '~1.0.3',     },     scripts: {         build: './lib/cli.js -c package.json5',         test: 'mocha --ui exports --reporter spec',     },     homepage: 'http://json5.org/',     repository: {         type: 'git',         url: 'https://github.com/aseemk/json5.git',     }, } ```   ## Community  Join the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/json5) if you're interested in JSON5 news, updates, and general discussion. Don't worry, it's very low-traffic.  The [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/wiki) is a good place to track JSON5 support and usage. Contribute freely there!  [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues) is the place to formally propose feature requests and report bugs. Questions and general feedback are better directed at the Google Group.   ## Usage  This JavaScript implementation of JSON5 simply provides a `JSON5` object just like the native ES5 `JSON` object.  To use from Node:  ``` npm install json5 ```  ```js var JSON5 = require('json5'); ```  To use in the browser (adds the `JSON5` object to the global namespace):  ``` <script src='json5.js'></script> ```  Then in both cases, you can simply replace native `JSON` calls with `JSON5`:  ```js var obj = JSON5.parse('{unquoted:'key',trailing:'comma',}'); var str = JSON5.stringify(obj); ```  `JSON5.parse` supports all of the JSON5 features listed above (*TODO: except Unicode*), as well as the native [`reviver` argument][json-parse].  [json-parse]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse  `JSON5.stringify` mainly avoids quoting keys where possible, but we hope to keep expanding it in the future (e.g. to also output trailing commas). It supports the native [`replacer` and `space` arguments][json-stringify], as well. *(TODO: Any implemented `toJSON` methods aren't used today.)*  [json-stringify]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify   ### Extras  If you're running this on Node, you can also register a JSON5 `require()` hook to let you `require()` `.json5` files just like you can `.json` files:  ```js require('json5/lib/require'); require('./path/to/foo');   // tries foo.json5 after foo.js, foo.json, etc. require('./path/to/bar.json5'); ```  This module also provides a `json5` executable (requires Node) for converting JSON5 files to JSON:  ``` $ json5 -c path/to/foo.json5    # generates path/to/foo.json ```   ## Development  ``` git clone git://github.com/aseemk/json5.git cd json5 npm install npm test ```  As the `package.json5` file states, be sure to run `npm run build` on changes to `package.json5`, since npm requires `package.json`.  Feel free to [file issues](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues) and submit [pull requests](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/pulls) — contributions are welcome. If you do submit a pull request, please be sure to add or update the tests, and ensure that `npm test` continues to pass.   ## License  MIT License. © 2012 Aseem Kishore, and [others]( https://github.com/aseemk/json5/contributors).   ## Credits  [Michael Bolin](http://bolinfest.com/) independently arrived at and published some of these same ideas with awesome explanations and detail. Recommended reading: [Suggested Improvements to JSON](http://bolinfest.com/essays/json.html)  [Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/) of course designed and built JSON, but his state machine diagrams on the [JSON website](http://json.org/), as cheesy as it may sound, gave me motivation and confidence that building a new parser to implement these ideas this was within my reach! This code is also modeled directly off of Doug's open-source [json_parse.js][] parser. I'm super grateful for that clean and well-documented code.  [json_parse.js]: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json_parse.js  [Max Nanasy](https://github.com/MaxNanasy) has been an early and prolific supporter, contributing multiple patches and ideas. Thanks Max!  [Andrew Eisenberg](https://github.com/aeisenberg) has contributed the `stringify` method."

"leek@0.0.18","https://github.com/twokul/leek","MIT","## Leek  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twokul/leek.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/twokul/leek)  Initial implementation was based on [Insight](https://github.com/yeoman/insight).  ### Track Events:  ```javascript var Leek = require('./lib/leek'),     leek = new Leek({       trackingCode: 'xx-xxxxxxxx-x',       globalName:   'my-nifty-package',       version:      '1.0.1'     });  leek.trackEvent({   name:     'my-nifty-package',   category: 'pony show',   label:    'white',   value:    'jumps' }); ```  ### Track Errors:  ```javascript var Leek = require('./lib/leek'),     leek = new Leek({       trackingCode: 'xx-xxxxxxxx-x',       name:         'my-nifty-package',       version:      '1.0.1'     });  try {   throw new Error('ZOMG FIX ME') } catch(e) {   leek.trackError({     description: e.message + ' ' + e.stack,     isFatal: true   }); } ```  ### Track command hits:  ```javascript var Leek = require('./lib/leek'),     leek = new Leek({       trackingCode: 'xx-xxxxxxxx-x',       name:         'my-nifty-package',       version:      '1.0.1'     });  leek.track({   name:    'my-nifty-package show pony',   message: 'pony is here' }); ```  ### Disable Tracking:  #### Environment Variable  Setting the `DISABLE_LEEK` environment variable will disable tracking.  #### Alternative Tracking Endpoints  Passing in an object of adapter URLs will send the data to alternative tracking service.  ```javascript var Leek = require('./lib/leek'); var leek = new Leek({   trackingCode: 'xx-xxxxxxxx-x',   name:         'my-nifty-package',   version:      '1.0.1',   adapterUrls: {     appview: 'http://example.com/collect-app',     exception: 'http://example.com/collect-exception',     timing: 'http://example.com/collect-timing',     event: 'http://example.com/collect-event'   } }); ```  #### Constructor Options  ```javascript var Leek = require('./lib/leek'); var leek = new Leek({   trackingCode: 'xx-xxxxxxxx-x',   name:         'my-nifty-package',   version:      '1.0.1',   silent:       true }); ```  ### GA Setup You are now able to set up alternative tracking services but to set up GA follow these steps:  * Set your new property up as a Mobile App * Add the Tracking ID in your leek initialisation as seen above. * To add the NodeJS as well as OS Version tracking go to the Admin -> Custom Definitions -> Custom Metrics * Add a new Custom Dimenstion with the Name `OS` and Scope `Session` * Add a second Custom Dimenstion with the Name `Node Version` and Scope `Session` as well * Make sure they are both active and you have everything you need to get the tracking running properly"

"magic-string@0.4.9","https://github.com/rich-harris/magic-string","MIT","# magic-string  Suppose you have some source code. You want to make some light modifications to it - replacing a few characters here and there, wrapping it with a header and footer, etc - and ideally you'd like to generate a source map at the end of it. You've thought about using something like [recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast) (which allows you to generate an AST from some JavaScript, manipulate it, and reprint it with a sourcemap without losing your comments and formatting), but it seems like overkill for your needs (or maybe the source code isn't JavaScript).  Your requirements are, frankly, rather niche. But they're requirements that I also have, and for which I made magic-string. It's a small, fast utility for manipulating strings and generating sourcemaps.  ## Installation  magic-string works in both node.js and browser environments. For node, install with npm:  ```bash npm i magic-string ```  To use in browser, grab the [magic-string.deps.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string/master/dist/magic-string.deps.js) file and add it to your page:  ```html <script src='magic-string.deps.js'></script> ```  (It also works with various module systems, if you prefer that sort of thing - it has a dependency on [vlq](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/vlq).)  ## Usage  These examples assume you're in node.js, or something similar:  ```js var MagicString = require( 'magic-string' ); var string = new MagicString( 'problems = 99' );  s.replace( 0, 8, 'answer' ); s.toString(); // 'answer = 99' s.locate( 9 ); // 7 - the character originally at index 9 ('=') is now at index 7 s.locateOrigin( 7 ); // 9  s.replace( 11, 13, '42' ); // character indices always refer to the original string s.toString(); // 'answer = 42'  s.prepend( 'var ' ).append( ';' ); // most methods are chainable s.toString(); // 'var answer = 42;'  var map = s.generateMap({   source: 'source.js',   file: 'converted.js.map',   includeContent: true }); // generates a v3 sourcemap  require( 'fs' ).writeFile( 'converted.js', s.toString() ); require( 'fs' ).writeFile( 'converted.js.map', map.toString() ); ```  ## Methods  ### s.addSourcemapLocation( index )  Adds the specified character index (with respect to the original string) to sourcemap mappings, if `hires` is `false` (see below).  ### s.append( content )  Appends the specified content to the end of the string. Returns `this`.  ### s.clone()  Does what you'd expect.  ### s.generateMap( options )  Generates a [version 3 sourcemap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit). All options are, well, optional:  * `file` - the filename where you plan to write the sourcemap * `source` - the filename of the file containing the original source * `includeContent` - whether to include the original content in the map's `sourcesContent` array * `hires` - whether the mapping should be high-resolution. Hi-res mappings map every single character, meaning (for example) your devtools will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of function calls and so on. With lo-res mappings, devtools may only be able to identify the correct line - but they're quicker to generate and less bulky. If sourcemap locations have been specified with `s.addSourceMapLocation()`, they will be used here.  The `names` property of the sourcemap is not currently populated.  The returned sourcemap has two (non-enumerable) methods attached for convenience:  * `toString` - returns the equivalent of `JSON.stringify(map)` * `toUrl` - returns a DataURI containing the sourcemap. Useful for doing this sort of thing:  ```js code += '\n//# sourceMappingURL=' + map.toUrl(); ```  ### s.indent( prefix[, options] )  Prefixes each line of the string with `prefix`. If `prefix` is not supplied, the indentation will be guessed from the original content, falling back to a single tab character. Returns `this`.  The `options` argument can have an `exclude` property, which is an array of `[start, end]` character ranges. These ranges will be excluded from the indentation - useful for (e.g.) multiline strings.  ### s.insert( index, content )  Inserts the specified `content` at the `index` in the original string. Returns `this`.  ### s.locate( index )  Finds the location, in the generated string, of the character at `index` in the original string. Returns `null` if the character in question has been removed or replaced.  ### s.locateOrigin( index )  The opposite of `s.locate()`. Returns `null` if the character in question was inserted with `s.append()`, `s.prepend()` or `s.replace()`.  ### s.prepend( content )  Prepends the string with the specified content. Returns `this`.  ### s.remove( start, end )  Removes the characters from `start` to `end` (of the original string, **not** the generated string). Removing the same content twice, or making removals that partially overlap, will cause an error. Returns `this`.  ### s.replace( start, end, content )  Replaces the characters from `start` to `end` with `content`. The same restrictions as `s.remove()` apply. Returns `this`.  ### s.slice( start, end )  Returns the content of the generated string that corresponds to the slice between `start` and `end` of the original string. Throws error if the indices are for characters that were already removed.  ### s.toString()  Returns the generated string.  ### s.trim([ charType ])  Trims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the start and end. Returns `this`.  ### s.trimStart([ charType ])  Trims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the start. Returns `this`.  ### s.trimEnd([ charType ])  Trims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the end. Returns `this`.  ### s.trimLines()  Removes empty lines from the start and end. Returns `this`.  ## Bundling  To concatenate several sources, use `MagicString.Bundle`:  ```js var bundle = new MagicString.Bundle();  bundle.addSource({   filename: 'foo.js',   content: new MagicString( 'var answer = 42;' ) });  bundle.addSource({   filename: 'bar.js',   content: new MagicString( 'console.log( answer )' ) });  // Advanced: a source can include an `indentExclusionRanges` property // alongside `filename` and `content`. This will be passed to `s.indent()` // - see documentation above  bundle.indent() // optionally, pass an indent string, otherwise it will be guessed   .prepend( '(function () {\n' )   .append( '}());' );  bundle.toString(); // (function () { //   var answer = 42; //   console.log( answer ); // }());  // options are as per `s.generateMap()` above var map = bundle.generateMap({   file: 'bundle.js',   includeContent: true,   hires: true }); ```  ## License  MIT"

"natives@1.1.3","https://github.com/addaleax/natives","ISC","# natives  Do stuff with Node.js's native JavaScript modules  ## Caveat  Dear Beloved User,  I feel compelled to give you a word of warning if you are considering using this module.  This module lets you do some creative things with the JavaScript code in Node.js.  There are some things here that are basically a recipe for memory leaks, or at the very least, being broken with each new release of Node, since none of these API surfaces are 'technically' 'supported' by the team managing the Node.js project.  This module does not ship a _copy_ of Node's internals.  It does its thing by using the exposed source code that lives in Node.js itself. So, running this on different versions of Node.js will produce different results.  When your program is broken by changes to Node's internals, or when Node changes in such a way that this module becomes fundamentally broken, you will likely get little sympathy.  Many people in the Node community consider this sort of behavior to be unwise and unseemly, if not outright hostile and morally wrong.  At the very least, you probably just want to run Node with the (undocumented!) `--expose-internals` flag, rather than go to such lengths.  Don't use unless you know what you're doing, or at least, are ok with the risks.  Don't say I didn't warn you.  Eternally Yours in OSS,   Isaac Z. Schlueter  ## USAGE  ```javascript var natives = require('natives')  // get the source code var fsCode = natives.source('fs')  // get a evaluated copy of the module var fsCopy = natives.require('fs')  // you can pass in a whitelist to NOT shim certain things var fsCopyWithNativeStreams = natives.require('fs', ['stream'])  // note that this is not the same as the 'real' fs assert(fsCopy !== require('fs'))  // but it does have all the same entries fsCopy.readFileSync(__filename, 'utf8') // etc ```  ## Another Caveat  You can't use this to override `require('buffer')` because everything depends on `Buffer.isBuffer` working properly, so it's important for that one to be given a pass."

"npm@2.12.1","https://github.com/npm/npm","Artistic-2.0","Copyright (c) npm, Inc. and Contributors All rights reserved.  npm is released under the Artistic License 2.0, subject to additional terms that are listed below.  The text of the npm License follows and the text of the additional terms follows the Artistic License 2.0 terms:   --------   The Artistic License 2.0  Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble  This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.  You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.  Definitions      'Copyright Holder' means the individual(s) or organization(s)     named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.      'Contributor' means any party that has contributed code or other     material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's     procedures.      'You' and 'your' means any person who would like to copy,     distribute, or modify the Package.      'Package' means the collection of files distributed by the     Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of     those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard     Version, or a Modified Version.      'Distribute' means providing a copy of the Package or making it     accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or     organization, to others outside of your company or organization.      'Distributor Fee' means any fee that you charge for Distributing     this Package or providing support for this Package to another     party.  It does not mean licensing fees.      'Standard Version' refers to the Package if it has not been     modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested     by the Copyright Holder.      'Modified Version' means the Package, if it has been changed, and     such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright     Holder.      'Original License' means this Artistic License as Distributed with     the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as     it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.      'Source' form means the source code, documentation source, and     configuration files for the Package.      'Compiled' form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,     or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or     translation of the Source form.   Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution  (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.   Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version  (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.  (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.   Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source  (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:      (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder     of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the     Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard     Version.      (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not     prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In     addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different     from the name of the Standard Version.      (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to     make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others     under          (i)  the Original License or          (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,         modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same         licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee         received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified         Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely         available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor         Fees are allowed.   Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source  (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.  (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.   Aggregating or Linking the Package  (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.  (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.   Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version  (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.   General Provisions  (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.  (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.  (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.  (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.  (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS 'AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.   --------   The following additional terms shall apply to use of the npm software, the npm website, the npm repository and any other services or products offered by npm, Inc.:  'Node.js' trademark Joyent, Inc.  npm is not officially part of the Node.js project, and is neither owned by nor affiliated with Joyent, Inc.

"path-array@1.0.0","https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-path-array","MIT","path-array ========== ### Treat your `$PATH` like a JavaScript Array [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/path-array.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/path-array)  This module provides a JavaScript `Array` implementation that is backed by your `$PATH` env variable. That is, you can use regular Array functions like `shift()`, `pop()`, `push()`, `unshift()`, etc. to mutate your `$PATH`.  Also works for preparing an `env` object for passing to [`child_process.spawn()`][cp.spawn].   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install path-array ```   Example -------  Interacting with your own `$PATH` env variable:  ``` js var PathArray = require('path-array');  // no args uses `process.env` by default var p = new PathArray();  console.log(p); // [ './node_modules/.bin', //   '/opt/local/bin', //   '/opt/local/sbin', //   '/usr/local/bin', //   '/usr/local/sbin', //   '/usr/bin', //   '/bin', //   '/usr/sbin', //   '/sbin', //   '/usr/local/bin', //   '/opt/X11/bin' ]  // push another path entry. this function mutates the `process.env.PATH` p.unshift('/foo');  console.log(process.env.PATH); // '/foo:./node_modules/.bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin' ```   API ---  ### new PathArray([env]) → PathArray  Creates and returns a new `PathArray` instance with the given `env` object. If no `env` is specified, then [`process.env`][process.env] is used by default.

"raw-body@1.3.0","https://github.com/stream-utils/raw-body","MIT","# raw-body  [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/raw-body.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/raw-body) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stream-utils/raw-body.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stream-utils/raw-body) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/stream-utils/raw-body.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/stream-utils/raw-body)  Gets the entire buffer of a stream either as a `Buffer` or a string. Validates the stream's length against an expected length and maximum limit. Ideal for parsing request bodies.  ## API  ```js var getRawBody = require('raw-body') var typer      = require('media-typer')  app.use(function (req, res, next) {   getRawBody(req, {     length: req.headers['content-length'],     limit: '1mb',     encoding: typer.parse(req.headers['content-type']).parameters.charset   }, function (err, string) {     if (err)       return next(err)      req.text = string     next()   }) }) ```  or in a Koa generator:  ```js app.use(function* (next) {   var string = yield getRawBody(this.req, {     length: this.length,     limit: '1mb',     encoding: this.charset   }) }) ```  ### getRawBody(stream, [options], [callback])  Returns a thunk for yielding with generators.  Options:  - `length` - The length length of the stream.   If the contents of the stream do not add up to this length,   an `400` error code is returned. - `limit` - The byte limit of the body.   If the body ends up being larger than this limit,   a `413` error code is returned. - `encoding` - The requested encoding.   By default, a `Buffer` instance will be returned.   Most likely, you want `utf8`.   You can use any type of encoding supported by [iconv-lite](https://www.npmjs.org/package/iconv-lite#readme).  You can also pass a string in place of options to just specify the encoding.  `callback(err, res)`:  - `err` - the following attributes will be defined if applicable:      - `limit` - the limit in bytes     - `length` and `expected` - the expected length of the stream     - `received` - the received bytes     - `encoding` - the invalid encoding     - `status` and `statusCode` - the corresponding status code for the error     - `type` - either `entity.too.large`, `request.size.invalid`, `stream.encoding.set`, or `encoding.unsupported`  - `res` - the result, either as a `String` if an encoding was set or a `Buffer` otherwise.  If an error occurs, the stream will be paused, everything unpiped, and you are responsible for correctly disposing the stream. For HTTP requests, no handling is required if you send a response. For streams that use file descriptors, you should `stream.destroy()` or `stream.close()` to prevent leaks.  ## License  The MIT License (MIT)  Copyright (c) 2013 Jonathan Ong me@jongleberry.com  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

This module include fixes seen in later version (0.11) and ease some undesirable behavior one could see using the readline to create interatives prompts. This means `readline2` change some behaviors and as so is **not** meant to be a drop-in replacement.  This project is extracted from the core of [Inquirer.js interactive prompt interface](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) to be available as a standalone module.   Documentation -------------  **Installation**: `npm install --save readline2`  ### readline2.createInterface( options ); -> {Interface}  Present the same API as [Node.js `readline.createInterface()`](http://nodejs.org/api/readline.html)  #### Improvements - Default `options.input` as `process.stdin` - Default `options.output` as `process.stdout` - `interface.stdout` is wrapped in a [MuteStream](https://github.com/isaacs/mute-stream) - Prevent `up` and `down` keys from moving through history inside the readline - Fix cursor position after a line refresh when the `Interface` prompt contains ANSI colors   License -------------  Copyright (c) 2012 Simon Boudrias (twitter: [@vaxilart](https://twitter.com/Vaxilart)) Licensed under the MIT license."

"rsvp@3.0.17","https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js","MIT","# RSVP.js  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tildeio/rsvp.js.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/tildeio/rsvp.js)  RSVP.js provides simple tools for organizing asynchronous code.  Specifically, it is a tiny implementation of Promises/A+.  It works in node and the browser (IE6+, all the popular evergreen ones).  ## downloads  - [rsvp-latest](http://rsvpjs-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/rsvp-latest.js) - [rsvp-latest (minified)](http://rsvpjs-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/rsvp-latest.min.js)  ## Promises   Although RSVP is es6 compliant, it does bring along some extra toys. If you would prefer a strict es6 subset, I would suggest checking out our sibling project https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise, It is RSVP but stripped down to the es6 spec features.  ## Bower  `bower install -S rsvp`  ## NPM  `npm install --save rsvp`  `RSVP.Promise` is an implementation of [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec/) that passes the [test suite](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests).  It delivers all promises asynchronously, even if the value is already available, to help you write consistent code that doesn't change if the underlying data provider changes from synchronous to asynchronous.  It is compatible with [TaskJS](http://taskjs.org/), a library by Dave Herman of Mozilla that uses ES6 generators to allow you to write synchronous code with promises. It currently works in Firefox, and will work in any browser that adds support for ES6 generators. See the section below on TaskJS for more information.  ### Basic Usage  ```javascript var RSVP = require('rsvp');  var promise = new RSVP.Promise(function(resolve, reject) {   // succeed   resolve(value);   // or reject   reject(error); });  promise.then(function(value) {   // success }, function(value) {   // failure }); ```  Once a promise has been resolved or rejected, it cannot be resolved or rejected again.  Here is an example of a simple XHR2 wrapper written using RSVP.js:  ```javascript var getJSON = function(url) {   var promise = new RSVP.Promise(function(resolve, reject){     var client = new XMLHttpRequest();     client.open('GET', url);     client.onreadystatechange = handler;     client.responseType = 'json';     client.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');     client.send();      function handler() {       if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {         if (this.status === 200) { resolve(this.response); }         else { reject(this); }       }     };   });    return promise; };  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {   // continue }, function(error) {   // handle errors }); ```  ### Chaining  One of the really awesome features of Promises/A+ promises are that they can be chained together. In other words, the return value of the first resolve handler will be passed to the second resolve handler.  If you return a regular value, it will be passed, as is, to the next handler.  ```javascript getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {   return json.post; }).then(function(post) {   // proceed }); ```  The really awesome part comes when you return a promise from the first handler:  ```javascript getJSON('/post/1.json').then(function(post) {   // save off post   return getJSON(post.commentURL); }).then(function(comments) {   // proceed with access to post and comments }); ```  This allows you to flatten out nested callbacks, and is the main feature of promises that prevents 'rightward drift' in programs with a lot of asynchronous code.  Errors also propagate:  ```javascript getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(posts) {  }).catch(function(error) {   // since no rejection handler was passed to the   // first `.then`, the error propagates. }); ```  You can use this to emulate `try/catch` logic in synchronous code. Simply chain as many resolve callbacks as a you want, and add a failure handler at the end to catch errors.  ```javascript getJSON('/post/1.json').then(function(post) {   return getJSON(post.commentURL); }).then(function(comments) {   // proceed with access to posts and comments }).catch(function(error) {   // handle errors in either of the two requests }); ```  You can also use `catch` for error handling, which is a shortcut for `then(null, rejection)`, like so:  ```javascript getJSON('/post/1.json').then(function(post) {   return getJSON(post.commentURL); }).catch(function(error) {   // handle errors }); ```  ## Error Handling  There are times when dealing with promises that it seems like any errors are being 'swallowed', and not properly raised. This makes is extremely difficult to track down where a given issue is coming from. Thankfully, `RSVP` has a solution for this problem built in.  You can register functions to be called when an uncaught error occurs within your promises. These callback functions can be anything, but a common practice is to call `console.assert` to dump the error to the console.  ```javascript RSVP.on('error', function(reason) {   console.assert(false, reason); }); ```  **NOTE:** promises do allow for errors to be handled asynchronously, so this callback may result in false positives.  **NOTE:** Usage of `RSVP.configure('onerror', yourCustomFunction);` is deprecated in favor of using `RSVP.on`.   ## Finally  `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate, just as native try/catch/finally behaves.  ```js findAuthor().catch(function(reason){   return findOtherAuthor(); }).finally(function(){   // author was either found, or not }); ```   ## Arrays of promises  Sometimes you might want to work with many promises at once. If you pass an array of promises to the `all()` method it will return a new promise that will be fulfilled when all of the promises in the array have been fulfilled; or rejected immediately if any promise in the array is rejected.  ```javascript var promises = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13].map(function(id){   return getJSON('/post/' + id + '.json'); });  RSVP.all(promises).then(function(posts) {   // posts contains an array of results for the given promises }).catch(function(reason){   // if any of the promises fails. }); ```  ## Hash of promises  If you need to reference many promises at once (like `all()`), but would like to avoid encoding the actual promise order you can use `hash()`. If you pass an object literal (where the values are promises) to the `hash()` method it will return a new promise that will be fulfilled when all of the promises have been fulfilled; or rejected immediately if any promise is rejected.  The key difference to the `all()` function is that both the fulfillment value and the argument to the `hash()` function are object literals. This allows you to simply reference the results directly off the returned object without having to remember the initial order like you would with `all()`.  ```javascript var promises = {   posts: getJSON('/posts.json'),   users: getJSON('/users.json') };  RSVP.hash(promises).then(function(results) {   console.log(results.users) // print the users.json results   console.log(results.posts) // print the posts.json results }); ```  ## All settled and hash settled  Sometimes you want to work with several promises at once, but instead of rejecting immediately if any promise is rejected, as with `all()` or `hash()`, you want to be able to inspect the results of all your promises, whether they fulfill or reject. For this purpose, you can use `allSettled()` and `hashSettled()`. These work exactly like `all()` and `hash()`, except that they fulfill with an array or hash (respectively) of the constituent promises' result states. Each state object will either indicate fulfillment or rejection, and provide the corresponding value or reason. The states will take one of the following formats:  ```javascript { state: 'fulfilled', value: value }   or { state: 'rejected', reason: reason } ```  ## Deferred  > The `RSVP.Promise` constructor is generally a better, less error-prone choice > than `RSVP.defer()`. Promises are recommended unless the specific  > properties of deferred are needed.  Sometimes one needs to create a deferred object, without immediately specifying how it will be resolved. These deferred objects are essentially a wrapper around a promise, whilst providing late access to the `resolve()` and `reject()` methods.  A deferred object has this form: `{ promise, resolve(x), reject(r) }`.  ```javascript var deferred = RSVP.defer(); // ... deferred.promise // access the promise // ... deferred.resolve();  ```  ## TaskJS  The [TaskJS](http://taskjs.org/) library makes it possible to take promises-oriented code and make it synchronous using ES6 generators.  Let's review an earlier example:  ```javascript getJSON('/post/1.json').then(function(post) {   return getJSON(post.commentURL); }).then(function(comments) {   // proceed with access to posts and comments }).catch(function(reason) {   // handle errors in either of the two requests }); ```  Without any changes to the implementation of `getJSON`, you could write the following code with TaskJS:  ```javascript spawn(function *() {   try {     var post = yield getJSON('/post/1.json');     var comments = yield getJSON(post.commentURL);   } catch(error) {     // handle errors   } }); ```  In the above example, `function *` is new syntax in ES6 for [generators](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:generators). Inside a generator, `yield` pauses the generator, returning control to the function that invoked the generator. In this case, the invoker is a special function that understands the semantics of Promises/A, and will automatically resume the generator as soon as the promise is resolved.  The cool thing here is the same promises that work with current JavaScript using `.then` will work seamlessly with TaskJS once a browser has implemented it!  ## Instrumentation  ```js function listener (event) {   event.guid      // guid of promise. Must be globally unique, not just within the implementation   event.childGuid // child of child promise (for chained via `then`)   event.eventName // one of ['created', 'chained', 'fulfilled', 'rejected']   event.detail    // fulfillment value or rejection reason, if applicable   event.label     // label passed to promise's constructor   event.timeStamp // milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC up until now   event.stack     // stack at the time of the event. (if  'instrument-with-stack' is true) }  RSVP.configure('instrument', true | false); // capturing the stacks is slow, so you also have to opt in RSVP.configure('instrument-with-stack', true | false);  // events RSVP.on('created', listener); RSVP.on('chained', listener); RSVP.on('fulfilled', listener); RSVP.on('rejected', listener); ```          Events are only triggered when `RSVP.configure('instrument')` is true, although listeners can be registered at any time.  ## Building & Testing  Custom tasks:  * `npm test` - build & test * `npm test:node` - build & test just node * `npm test:server` - build/watch & test * `npm run build` - Build * `npm run build:production` - Build production (with minified output) * `npm start` - build, watch and run interactive server at http://localhost:4200'  ## Releasing  Check what release-it will do by running `npm run-script dry-run-release`. To actually release, run `node_modules/.bin/release-it`."

"sander@0.2.4","https://github.com/rich-harris/sander","MIT","# sander  A Promise-based power tool for common filesystem tasks in node.js.  ## Installation  ```bash npm install sander ```  ## Another wrapper around `fs`? Really?  Yup. Working with the low-level `fs` API is the fastest road to callback hell, and while a lot of the existing `fs` wrappers add a whole load of missing features, they don't really mitigate the fundamental suckiness of working with the filesystem in a painful, imperative way, which forces you to handle errors at every step of the journey towards the centre of the node.js [pyramid of doom](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=pyramid+of+doom).  **Enough! Manual filing is tedious - you need a power tool.** Instead of writing this...  ```js var path = require( 'path' ),     fs = require( 'fs' ),     mkdirp = require( 'mkdirp' );  var dest = path.resolve( basedir, filename );  mkdirp( path.dirname( dest ), function ( err ) {   if ( err ) throw err;    fs.writeFile( dest, data, function ( err ) {     if ( err ) throw err;     doTheNextThing();   }); }); ```  ...write this:  ```js var sander = require( 'sander' ); sander.writeFile( basedir, filename, data ).then( doTheNextThing ); ```  It uses [graceful-fs](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs) rather than the built-in `fs` module, to eliminate [EMFILE](http://blog.izs.me/post/56827866110/wtf-is-emfile-and-why-does-it-happen-to-me) from the list of things you have to worry about.   ## Conventions  ### Promises  All async methods (those whose `fs` equivalents would take a callback, e.g. `sander.readFile`) return a Promise. If you're not familiar with Promises, [read up on them on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) - they're coming in ES6 and are already supported in many browsers, and I guarantee they'll make your life easier.  (Node doesn't natively support promises yet - we're using [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) for maximum compatibility. For convenience, the `Promise` constructor is exposed as `sander.Promise`.)  ### Intermediate folder creation  When writing files and folders, intermediate folders are automatically created as necessary. (I've never encountered a situation where I wanted an `ENOENT` error instead of having this be done for me.)  ### Automatic path resolution  Wherever appropriate, method arguments are joined together with `path.resolve()` - so the following are equivalent:  ```js sander.readFile( 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ); sander.readFile( path.resolve( 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ) ); sander.readFile( 'foo/bar/baz' ); // or 'foo\bar\baz' on Windows ```  ### Methods that involve two paths  Some operations, such as renaming files, require two paths to be specified. The convention for handling this in sander is as follows:  ```js sander.rename( basedir, oldname ).to( basedir, newname ); ```    ## Methods  ### `fs` methods  In addition to the extra methods (listed below), all `fs` methods have `sander` equivalents. The synchronous methods (those ending `Sync`) are the same as the `fs` originals except that path resolution and intermediate folder creation are automatically handled (see [conventions](#conventions), above). All async methods return a promise.  For more information about what these methods do, consult the [node documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html).  In the list below, `...paths` indicates you can use one or more strings in sequence, as per the [automatic path resolution](#automatic-path-resolution) convention. An `fd` argument refers to a file descriptor, which you'd generate with `sander.open()` or `sander.openSync()`. Arguments wrapped in `[]` characters are optional.  ```js sander.appendFile(...paths, data, [options]) sander.appendFileSync(...paths, data, [options]) sander.chmod(...paths, {mode: mode}) sander.chmodSync(...paths, {mode: mode}) sander.chown(...paths, uid, gid) sander.chownSync(...paths, uid, gid) sander.close(fd) sander.closeSync(fd) sander.createReadStream(...paths, [options]) sander.createWriteStream(...paths, [options]) sander.exists(...paths) sander.existsSync(...paths) sander.fchmod(fd, {mode: mode}) sander.fchmodSync(fd, {mode: mode}) sander.fchown(fd, uid, gid) sander.fchownSync(fd, uid, gid) sander.fstat(fd) sander.fstatSync(fd) sander.fsync(fd) sander.fsyncSync(fd) sander.ftruncate(fd, len) sander.ftruncateSync(fd, len) sander.futimes(fd, atime, mtime) sander.futimesSync(fd, atime, mtime) sander.lchmod(...paths, {mode: mode}) sander.lchmodSync(...paths, {mode: mode}) sander.lchown(...paths, uid, gid) sander.lchownSync(...paths, uid, gid) sander.link(...paths).to(...paths) sander.linkSync(...paths).to(...paths) sander.lstat(...paths) sander.lstatSync(...paths) sander.mkdir(...paths, [{mode: mode}]) sander.mkdirSync(...paths, [{mode: mode}]) sander.open(...paths, flags, [{mode: mode}]) sander.openSync(...paths, flags, [{mode: mode}]) sander.read(fd, buffer, offset, length, position) sander.readSync(fd, buffer, offset, length, position) sander.readdir(...paths) sander.readdirSync(...paths) sander.readFile(...paths, [options]) sander.readFileSync(...paths, [options]) sander.readlink(...paths) sander.readlinkSync(...paths) sander.realpath(...paths, [cache]) sander.realpathSync(...paths, [cache]) sander.rename(...paths).to(...paths) sander.renameSync(...paths).to(...paths) sander.rmdir(...paths) sander.rmdirSync(...paths) sander.stat(...paths) sander.statSync(...paths) sander.symlink(...paths).to(...paths, [{type: type}]) sander.symlinkSync(...paths).to(...paths, [{type: type}]) sander.truncate(...paths, len) sander.truncateSync(...paths, len) sander.unlink(...paths) sander.unlinkSync(...paths) sander.utimes(...paths, atime, mtime) sander.utimesSync(...paths, atime, mtime) sander.unwatchFile(...paths, [listener]) sander.watch(...paths, [options], [listener]) sander.watchFile(...paths, [options], listener) sander.write(fd, buffer, offset, length, position) sander.writeSync(fd, buffer, offset, length, position) sander.writeFile(...paths, data, [options]) sander.writeFileSync(...paths, data, [options]) ```  Note that with the `chmod`/`fchmod`/`lchmod`/`symlink`/`mkdir`/`open` methods (and their synchronous equivalents), the `mode` and `type` arguments must be passed as objects with a `mode` or `type` property. This is so that sander knows which arguments should be treated as parts of a path (because they're strings) and which shouldn't.   ### Extra methods  ```js // Copy a file using streams. `readOptions` is passed to `fs.createReadStream`, // while `writeOptions` is passed to `fs.createWriteStream` sander.copyFile(...paths, [readOptions]).to(...paths, [writeOptions])  // Copy a file synchronously. `readOptions`, is passed to `fs.readFileSync`, // while `writeOptions` is passed to `fs.writeFileSync` sander.copyFileSync(...paths, [readOptions]).to(...paths, [writeOptions])  // Copy a directory, recursively. `readOptions` and `writeOptions` are // treated as per `sander.copyFile[Sync]` sander.copydir(...paths, [readOptions]).to(...paths, [writeOptions]) sander.copydirSync(...paths, [readOptions]).to(...paths, [writeOptions])  // List contents of a directory, recursively sander.lsr(...paths) sander.lsrSync(...paths)  // Remove a directory and its contents sander.rimraf(...paths) sander.rimrafSync(...paths) ```   ### License  MIT"
"sane@1.7.0","https://github.com/amasad/sane","MIT","[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane)  sane ----  I've been driven to insanity by node filesystem watcher wrappers. Sane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does that by:  * By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive * Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues * Maintains a consistent API across different platforms * Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:   * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)   * polling  ## Install  ``` $ npm install sane ```  ## How to choose a mode  Don't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane maintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.  * If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode * If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode * If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman` * If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling * Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you  ## API  ### sane(dir, options)  Watches a directory and all it's descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.  ```js var watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']}); watcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') }); watcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); }); watcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); }); watcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); }); // close watcher.close(); ```  options:  * `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them. * `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`. * `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/). * `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot. * `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.  For the glob pattern documentation, see [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch). If you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)). For the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).  ### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)  The default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(options, dir)`.  ### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)  The watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(options, dir)`.  ### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)  The polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(options, dir)` with the addition of:  * interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)  ### sane.{Node|Watchman|Poll}Watcher#close  Stops watching.  ### sane.{Node|Watchman|Poll}Watcher events  Emits the following events:  All events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory * `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory * `change` when a file changes * `add` when a file or directory has been added * `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted  ## CLI  This module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.  ``` Usage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]  OPTIONS:     --glob=<filePattern>         A single string glob pattern or an array of them.      --poll, -p       Use polling mode.      --watchman, -w       Use watchman (if available).      --dot, -d       Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.      --wait=<seconds>         Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled         after running <command>. Setting this option will         throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration. ```  It will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.  ### CLI example usage - `sane 'echo 'A command ran''` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' --glob='**/*.css'` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' --wait=3` - `sane 'echo 'A command ran'' -p`  ## License  MIT  ## Credits The CLI was originally based on the [watch CLI](https://github.com/mikeal/watch).

"silent-error@1.1.0","https://github.com/stefanpenner/silent-error","ISC","# silent-error [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/silent-error.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/silent-error)  An error subclass for humanized errors. This module allows for inter-module detection of errors which are fatal, but where a stacktrace by default provides negative value.  Some use-cases:  * command in your CLI tool is missing * plugin to your build system is given invalid user-input.  Obviously stack traces can still be valuable. To view the stacks, the following environment variable can be set to `true`  ``` SILENT_ERROR=verbose <run program> ```  ## Example  ```js // in one node module async function runCommand(name) {    // some logic    throw new SilentError(`command: '${name}' is not installed`); } ```  ```js // in another node_module async function caller() {    try {     await runCommand('foo');   } catch(e) {     SilentError.debugOrThrow(e);   }    SilentError.debugOrThrow } ```  ## Installation  ``` yarn add silent-error ```  or  ``` npm install --save silent-error ```"

Usage =====  ### `sourceMappingURL.getFrom(code)` ###  Returns the url of the sourceMappingURL comment in `code`. Returns `null` if there is no such comment.  ### `sourceMappingURL.existsIn(code)` ###  Returns `true` if there is a sourceMappingURL comment in `code`, or `false` otherwise.  ### `sourceMappingURL.removeFrom(code)` ###  Removes the sourceMappingURL comment in `code`. Does nothing if there is no such comment. Returns the updated `code`.  ### `sourceMappingURL.insertBefore(code, string)` ###  Inserts `string` before the sourceMappingURL comment in `code`. Appends `string` to `code` if there is no such comment.  Lets you append something to a file without worrying about breaking the sourceMappingURL comment (which needs to be at the end of the file).  ### `sourceMappingURL.regex` ###  The regex that is used to match sourceMappingURL comments. It matches both `//` and `/**/` comments, thus supporting both JavaScript and CSS.   Tests =====  Start by running `npm test`, which lints the code and runs the test suite in Node.js.  To run the tests in a browser, run `testling` (`npm install -g testling`) or `testling -u`.   License =======  [The X11 (“MIT”) License](LICENSE)."

"source-map@0.4.4","https://github.com/mozilla/source-map","BSD-3-Clause","# Source Map  This is a library to generate and consume the source map format [described here][format].  This library is written in the Asynchronous Module Definition format, and works in the following environments:  * Modern Browsers supporting ECMAScript 5 (either after the build, or with an   AMD loader such as RequireJS)  * Inside Firefox (as a JSM file, after the build)  * With NodeJS versions 0.8.X and higher  ## Node      $ npm install source-map  ## Building from Source (for everywhere else)  Install Node and then run      $ git clone https://fitzgen@github.com/mozilla/source-map.git     $ cd source-map     $ npm link .  Next, run      $ node Makefile.dryice.js  This should spew a bunch of stuff to stdout, and create the following files:  * `dist/source-map.js` - The unminified browser version.  * `dist/source-map.min.js` - The minified browser version.  * `dist/SourceMap.jsm` - The JavaScript Module for inclusion in Firefox source.  ## Examples  ### Consuming a source map  ```js var rawSourceMap = {   version: 3,   file: 'min.js',   names: ['bar', 'baz', 'n'],   sources: ['one.js', 'two.js'],   sourceRoot: 'http://example.com/www/js/',   mappings: 'CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA' };  var smc = new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);  console.log(smc.sources); // [ 'http://example.com/www/js/one.js', //   'http://example.com/www/js/two.js' ]  console.log(smc.originalPositionFor({   line: 2,   column: 28 })); // { source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js', //   line: 2, //   column: 10, //   name: 'n' }  console.log(smc.generatedPositionFor({   source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',   line: 2,   column: 10 })); // { line: 2, column: 28 }  smc.eachMapping(function (m) {   // ... }); ```  ### Generating a source map  In depth guide: [**Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source Maps**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/)  #### With SourceNode (high level API)  ```js function compile(ast) {   switch (ast.type) {   case 'BinaryExpression':     return new SourceNode(       ast.location.line,       ast.location.column,       ast.location.source,       [compile(ast.left), ' + ', compile(ast.right)]     );   case 'Literal':     return new SourceNode(       ast.location.line,       ast.location.column,       ast.location.source,       String(ast.value)     );   // ...   default:     throw new Error('Bad AST');   } }  var ast = parse('40 + 2', 'add.js'); console.log(compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({   file: 'add.js' })); // { code: '40 + 2', //   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] } ```  #### With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)  ```js var map = new SourceMapGenerator({   file: 'source-mapped.js' });  map.addMapping({   generated: {     line: 10,     column: 35   },   source: 'foo.js',   original: {     line: 33,     column: 2   },   name: 'christopher' });  console.log(map.toString()); // '{'version':3,'file':'source-mapped.js','sources':['foo.js'],'names':['christopher'],'mappings':';;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA'}' ```  ## API  Get a reference to the module:  ```js // NodeJS var sourceMap = require('source-map');  // Browser builds var sourceMap = window.sourceMap;  // Inside Firefox let sourceMap = {}; Components.utils.import('resource:///modules/devtools/SourceMap.jsm', sourceMap); ```  ### SourceMapConsumer  A SourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can query for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position in the generated source.  #### new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)  The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which can be `JSON.parse`'d, or an object). According to the spec, source maps have the following attributes:  * `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.  * `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.  * `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual   mappings.  * `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.  * `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.  * `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.  * `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()  Compute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is inclusive.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)  Returns the original source, line, and column information for the generated source's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source.  * `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or   `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest   element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,   respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to   `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.  and an object is returned with the following properties:  * `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not   available.  * `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is   not available.  * `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this   information is not available.  * `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)  Returns the generated line and column information for the original source, line, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `source`: The filename of the original source.  * `line`: The line number in the original source.  * `column`: The column number in the original source.  and an object is returned with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)  Returns all generated line and column information for the original source, line, and column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings corresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line that has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the given line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column that has any offsets.  The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `source`: The filename of the original source.  * `line`: The line number in the original source.  * `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.  and an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()  Return true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in the source map, false otherwise.  In other words, if this method returns `true`, then `smc.sourceContentFor(s)` will succeed for every source `s` in `smc.sources`.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])  Returns the original source content for the source provided. The only argument is the URL of the original source file.  If the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is thrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned instead.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)  Iterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a generated line/column in this source map.  * `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the   form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,   name }`  * `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`   every time that `callback` is called.  * `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or   `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over   the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the   original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to   `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.  ### SourceMapGenerator  An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being built incrementally.  #### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])  You may pass an object with the following properties:  * `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is   associated with.  * `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.  * `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as   they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with   discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when   running tests, if possible.  #### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)  Creates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer  * `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)  Add a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated source's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object should have the following properties:  * `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.  * `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.  * `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).  * `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)  Set the source content for an original source file.  * `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.  * `sourceContent` the content of the source file.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])  Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap. Each mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the supplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings is the minimium of this map and the supplied map.  * `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.  * `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.   If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.   Otherwise an error will be thrown.  * `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap   to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.    This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same   directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source   paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten   relative to the SourceMap.    If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,   thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()  Renders the source map being generated to a string.  ### SourceNode  SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and column information associated between those snippets and the original source code. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might use before outputting the generated JS and source map.  #### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])  * `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if   it isn't associated with an original line.  * `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null   if it isn't associated with an original column.  * `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.  * `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see   below.  * `name`: Optional. The original identifier.  #### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])  Creates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.  * `code`: The generated code  * `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code  * `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`   should be relative to.  #### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)  Add a chunk of generated JS to this source node.  * `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of    `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.  #### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)  Prepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.  * `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of    `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.  #### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)  Set the source content for a source file. This will be added to the `SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.  * `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file  * `sourceContent`: The content of the source file  #### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)  Walk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and the its original associated source's line/column location.  * `fn`: The traversal function.  #### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)  Walk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each source file content and is passed the filename and source content.  * `fn`: The traversal function.  #### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)  Like `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator between each of this source node's children.  * `sep`: The separator.  #### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)  Call `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful for trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.  * `pattern`: The pattern to replace.  * `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.  #### SourceNode.prototype.toString()  Return the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and concatenates all the various snippets together to one string.  #### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])  Returns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a SourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and original sources.  The arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.  ## Tests  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)  Install NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.  To add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js` and export your test functions with names that start with 'test', for example  ```js exports['test doing the foo bar'] = function (assert, util) {   ... }; ```  The new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.  The `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.  The `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have access to the following assertion functions:  * `doesNotThrow`  * `equal`  * `ok`  * `strictEqual`  * `throws`  (The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the tests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is shimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)

"stable@0.1.8","https://github.com/Two-Screen/stable","MIT","## Stable  A stable array sort, because `Array#sort()` is not guaranteed stable.  MIT licensed.  [![Node.js CI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable)  [![Browser CI](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable)  #### From npm  Install with:  ```sh npm install stable ```  Then use it in Node.js or some other CommonJS environment as:  ```js const stable = require('stable') ```  #### From the browser  Include [`stable.js`] or the minified version [`stable.min.js`] in your page, then call `stable()`.   [`stable.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js  [`stable.min.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js  #### Usage  The default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:  ```js stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo'] stable([10, 1, 5])             // => [1, 10, 5] ```  Unlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:  ```js const arr = [10, 1, 5] stable(arr) === arr          // => false stable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true ```  A comparator function can be specified:  ```js // Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number. // This demonstrates the default behavior. const lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b) stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']  // Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true. // This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically. const greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10] ```  #### License  Copyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.

"testem@0.8.5","https://github.com/airportyh/testem","MIT","Got Scripts? Test&rsquo;em! =================  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/airportyh/testem.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/airportyh/testem) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/airportyh/testem.svg)](https://david-dm.org/airportyh/testem) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/testem.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/testem) [![Windows build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/l948rc4rv391ayge/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/johanneswuerbach/testem/branch/master)  Unit testing in Javascript can be tedious and painful, but Testem makes it so easy that you will actually *want* to write tests.  Features --------  * Test-framework agnostic. Support for     - [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)     - [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/)     - [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/)     - [Buster.js](http://docs.busterjs.org/)     - Others, through custom test framework adapters. * Run tests in all major browsers as well as [Node](http://nodejs.org) and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) * Two distinct use-cases:     - Test-Driven-Development(TDD) &mdash; designed to streamline the TDD workflow     - Continuous Integration(CI) &mdash; designed to work well with popular CI servers like Jenkins or Teamcity * Cross-platform support     - OS X     - Windows     - Linux * Preprocessor support     - CoffeeScript     - Browserify     - JSHint/JSLint     - everything else  Screencasts -----------  * Watch this **[introductory screencast (11:39)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1mjv4yk5JM)** to see it in action! This one demonstrates the TDD workflow. * [Launchers (12:10)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up0lVjWk9Rk) &mdash; more detail about launchers: how to specify what to auto-launch and how to configure one yourself to run tests in **Node**. * [Continuous Integration (CI) Mode (4:24)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js16Cj80HKY) &mdash; details about how CI mode works. * [Making JavaScript Testing Fun With Testem (22:53)](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/make-javascript-testing-fun-with-testem/) &mdash; a thorough screencast by NetTuts+'s Jeffery Way covering the basics, Jasmine, Mocha/Chai, CoffeeScript and more!  Installation ------------ You need [Node](http://nodejs.org/) version 0.10+ or iojs installed on your system. Node is extremely easy to install and has a small footprint, and is really awesome otherwise too, so [just do it](http://nodejs.org/).  Once you have Node installed:      npm install testem -g  This will install the `testem` executable globally on your system.  Usage -----  As stated before, Testem supports two use cases: test-driven-development and continuous integration. Let's go over each one.  Development Mode ----------------  The simplest way to use Testem, in the TDD spirit, is to start in an empty directory and run the command      testem  You will see a terminal-based interface which looks like this  ![Initial interface](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/raw/master/images/initial.png)  Now open your browser and go to the specified URL. You should now see  ![Zero of zero](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/raw/master/images/zeros.png)  We see 0/0 for tests because at this point we haven't written any code. As we write them, Testem will pick up any `.js` files that were added, include them, and if there are tests, run them automatically. So let's first write `hello_spec.js` in the spirit of 'test first'(written in Jasmine)  ```javascript describe('hello', function(){   it('should say hello', function(){     expect(hello()).toBe('hello world');   }); }); ``` Save that file and now you should see  ![Red](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/raw/master/images/red.png)  Testem should automatically pick up the new files you've added and also any changes that you make to them and rerun the tests. The test fails as we'd expect. Now we implement the spec like so in `hello.js`  ```javascript function hello(){   return 'hello world'; } ```  So you should now see  ![Green](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/raw/master/images/green.png)  ### Using the Text User Interface  In development mode, Testem has a text-based graphical user interface which uses keyboard-based controls. Here is a list of the control keys  * ENTER : Run the tests * q : Quit * ← LEFT ARROW  : Move to the next browser tab on the left * → RIGHT ARROW : Move to the next browser tab on the right * TAB : switch the target text panel between the top and bottom halves of the split panel (if a split is present) * ↑ UP ARROW : scroll up in the target text panel * ↓ DOWN ARROW : scroll down in the target text panel * SPACE : page down in the target text panel * b : page up in the target text panel * d : half a page down target text panel * u : half a page up target text panel  ### Command line options  To see all command line options      testem --help  Continuous Integration Mode ---------------------------  To use Testem for continuous integration      testem ci  In CI mode, Testem runs your tests on all the browsers that are available on the system one after another.  You can run multiple browsers in parallel in CI mode by specifying the `--parallel` (or `-P`) option to be the number of concurrent running browsers.      testem ci -P 5 # run 5 browser in parallel  To find out what browsers are currently available - those that Testem knows about and can make use of      testem launchers  Will print them out. The output might look like      $ testem launchers     Browsers available on this system:     IE7     IE8     IE9     Chrome     Firefox     Safari     Opera     PhantomJS  Did you notice that this system has IE versions 7-9? Yes, actually it has only IE9 installed, but Testem uses IE's compatibility mode feature to emulate IE 7 and 8.  When you run `testem ci` to run tests, it outputs the results in the [TAP](http://testanything.org/) format by default, which looks like      ok 1 Chrome 16.0 - hello should say hello.      1..1     # tests 1     # pass  1      # ok  TAP is a human-readable and language-agnostic test result format. TAP plugins exist for popular CI servers  * [Jenkins TAP plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin) - I've added [detailed instructions](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/blob/master/docs/use_with_jenkins.md) for setup with Jenkins. * [TeamCity TAP plugin](https://github.com/pavelsher/teamcity-tap-parser)  ## Other Test Reporters  Testem has other test reporters than TAP: `dot`, `xunit` and `teamcity`. You can use the `-R` to specify them      testem ci -R dot  ### Example xunit reporter output  Note that the real output is not pretty printed. ```xml <testsuite name='Testem Tests' tests='4' failures='1' timestamp='Wed Apr 01 2015 11:56:20 GMT+0100 (GMT Daylight Time)' time='9'>   <testcase classname='PhantomJS 1.9' name='myFunc returns true when input is valid' time='0'/>   <testcase classname='PhantomJS 1.9' name='myFunc returns false when user tickles it' time='0'/>   <testcase classname='Chrome' name='myFunc returns true when input is valid' time='0'/>   <testcase classname='Chrome' name='myFunc returns false when user tickles it' time='0'>     <failure name='myFunc returns false when user tickles it' message='function is not ticklish'>       <![CDATA[       Callstack...       ]]>     </failure>   </testcase> </testsuite> ```  ### Example teamcity reporter output      ##teamcity[testStarted name='PhantomJS 1.9 - hello should say hello']     ##teamcity[testFinished name='PhantomJS 1.9 - hello should say hello']     ##teamcity[testStarted name='PhantomJS 1.9 - hello should say hello to person']     ##teamcity[testFinished name='PhantomJS 1.9 - hello should say hello to person']     ##teamcity[testStarted name='PhantomJS 1.9 - goodbye should say goodbye']     ##teamcity[testFailed name='PhantomJS 1.9 - goodbye should say goodbye' message='expected |'hello world|' to equal |'goodbye world|'' details='AssertionError: expected |'hello world|' to equal |'goodbye world|'|n    at http://localhost:7357/testem/chai.js:873|n    at assertEqual (http://localhost:7357/testem/chai.js:1386)|n    at http://localhost:7357/testem/chai.js:3627|n    at http://localhost:7357/hello_spec.js:14|n    at callFn (http://localhost:7357/testem/mocha.js:4338)|n    at http://localhost:7357/testem/mocha.js:4331|n    at http://localhost:7357/testem/mocha.js:4728|n    at http://localhost:7357/testem/mocha.js:4819|n    at next (http://localhost:7357/testem/mocha.js:4653)|n    at http://localhost:7357/testem/mocha.js:4663|n    at next (http://localhost:7357/testem/mocha.js:4601)|n    at http://localhost:7357/testem/mocha.js:4630|n    at timeslice (http://localhost:7357/testem/mocha.js:5761)']     ##teamcity[testFinished name='PhantomJS 1.9 - goodbye should say goodbye']      ##teamcity[testSuiteFinished name='mocha.suite' duration='11091']   ### Command line options  To see all command line options for CI      testem ci --help  Configuration File ------------------  For the simplest JavaScript projects, the TDD workflow described above will work fine. There are times when you want to structure your source files into separate directories, or want to have finer control over what files to include. This calls for the `testem.json` configuration file (you can also alternatively use the YAML format with a `testem.yml` file). It looks like  ```json {   'framework': 'jasmine',   'src_files': [     'hello.js',     'hello_spec.js'   ] } ```  The `src_files` can also be unix glob patterns.  ```json {   'src_files': [     'js/**/*.js',     'spec/**/*.js'   ] } ```  You can also ignore certain files using `src_files_ignore`. ***Update: I've removed the ability to use a space-separated list of globs as a string in the src_files property because it disallowed matching files or directories with spaces in them.***  ```json {   'src_files': [     'js/**/*.js',     'spec/**/*.js'   ],   'src_files_ignore': 'js/toxic/*.js' } ```  Read [more details](docs/config_file.md) about the config options.  Custom Test Pages -----------------  You can also use a custom page for testing. To do this, first you need to specify `test_page` to point to your test page in the config file (`framework` and `src_files` are irrelevant in this case)  ```json {   'test_page': 'tests.html' } ```  Next, the test page you use needs to have the adapter code installed on them, as specified in the next section.  ### Include Snippet  Include this snippet directly after your `jasmine.js`, `qunit.js` or `mocha.js` or `buster.js` include to enable *Testem* with your test page.  ```html <script src='/testem.js'></script> ```  Or if you are using require.js or another loader, just make sure you load `/testem.js` as the next script after the test framework.  ### Dynamic Substitution  To enable dynamically substituting in the Javascript files in your custom test page, you must  1. name your test page using `.mustache` as the extension 2. use `{{#serve_files}}` to loop over the set of Javascript files to be served, and then reference its `src` property to access their path  Example:      {{#serve_files}}     <script src='{{src}}'></script>     {{/serve_files}}  Launchers ---------  Testem has the ability to automatically launch browsers or processes for you. To see the list of launchers Testem knows about, you can use the command      testem launchers  This will display something like the following      Have 5 launchers available; auto-launch info displayed on the right.      Launcher      Type          CI  Dev     ------------  ------------  --  ---     Chrome        browser       ✔     Firefox       browser       ✔     Safari        browser       ✔     Opera         browser       ✔     Mocha         process(TAP)  ✔  This displays the current list of launchers that are available. Launchers can launch either a browser or a custom process &mdash; as shown in the 'Type' column. Custom launchers can be defined to launch custom processes. The 'CI' column indicates the launchers which will be automatically launch in CI-mode. Similarly, the 'Dev' column those that will automatically launch in dev-mode.  Running Tests in Node and Custom Process Launchers --------------------------------------------------  To run tests in Node you need to create a custom launcher which launches a process which will run your tests. This is nice because it means you can use any test framework - or lack thereof. For example, to make a launcher that runs mocha tests, you would write the following in the config file `testem.json`  ```javascript 'launchers': {   'Mocha': {     'command': 'mocha tests/*_tests.js'   } } ```  When you run `testem`, it will auto-launch the mocha process based on the specified command every time the tests are run. It will display the stdout and well as the stderr of the process inside of the 'Mocha' tab in the UI. It will base the pass/fail status on the exit code of the process. In fact, because Testem can launch any arbitrary process for you, you could very well be using it to run programs in other languages.  Processes with TAP Output -------------------------  If your process outputs test results in [TAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol) format, you can tell that to testem via the `protocol` property. For example  ```javascript 'launchers': {   'Mocha': {     'command': 'mocha tests/*_tests.js -R tap',     'protocol': 'tap'   } } ```  When this is done, Testem will read in the process's stdout and parse it as TAP, and then display the test results in Testem's normal format. It will also hide the process's stdout output from the console log panel, although it will still display the stderr.  PhantomJS ---------  PhantomJS is a Webkit-based headless browser. It's fast and it's awesome! Testem will pick it up if you have [PhantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/) installed in your system and the `phantomjs` executable is in your path. Run      testem launchers  And verify that it's in the list.  If you want to debug tests in PhantomJS, include the `phantomjs_debug_port` option in your testem configuration, referencing an available port number.  Once testem has started PhantomJS, navigate (with a traditional browser) to http://localhost:<port> and attach to one of PhantomJS's browser tabs (probably the second one in the list).  `debugger` statements will now break in the debugging console.  Preprocessors (CoffeeScript, LESS, Sass, Browserify, etc) ---------------------------------------------------------  If you need to run a preprocessor (or indeed any shell command before the start of the tests) use the `before_tests` option, such as      'before_tests': 'coffee -c *.coffee'  And Testem will run it before each test run. For file watching, you may still use the `src_files` option  ```javascript 'src_files': [   '*.coffee' ] ```  Since you want to be serving the `.js` files that are generated and not the `.coffee` files, you want to specify the `serve_files` option to tell it that  ```javascript 'serve_files': [   '*.js' ] ```  Testem will throw up a big ol' error dialog if the preprocessor command exits with an error code, so code checkers like jshint can used here as well.  If you need to run a command after your tests have completed (such as removing compiled `.js` files), use the `after_tests` option.  ```javascript 'after_tests': 'rm *.js' ```  If you would prefer simply to clean up when Testem exits, you can use the `on_exit` option.  Custom Routes -------------  Sometimes you may want to re-map a URL to a different directory on the file system. Maybe you have the following file structure:      + src       + hello.js       + tests.js     + css       + styles.css     + public       + tests.html  Let's say you want to serve `tests.html` at the top level url `/tests.html`, all the Javascripts under `/js` and all the css under `/css` you can use the 'routes' option to do that  ```javascript 'routes': {   '/tests.html': 'public/tests.html',   '/js': 'src',   '/css': 'css' } ```  DIY: Use Any Test Framework ---------------------------  If you want to use Testem with a test framework that's not supported out of the box, you can write your own custom test framework adapter. See [customAdapter.js](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/blob/master/examples/custom_adapter/customAdapter.js) for an example of how to write a custom adapter.  Then, to use it, in your config file simply set  ```javascript 'framework': 'custom' ```  And then make sure you include the adapter code in your test suite and you are ready to go. Here for the [full example](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/tree/master/examples/custom_adapter).  Growl or Growl-ish Notifications --------------------------------  If you'd prefer not to be looking at the terminal while developing, you can us growl notification (or simply desktop notifications on some platforms) using the `-g` option.  But, to use this option, you may first need to install some additional software, see the [node-growl page](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-growl#install) for more details.  API Proxy --------------------------------  The proxy option allows you to transparently forward http requests to an external endpoint.  Simply add a `proxies` section to the `testem.json` configuration file.  ```json {   'proxies': {     '/api': {       'target': 'http://localhost:4200',       'onlyContentTypes': ['xml', 'json']     },     '/xmlapi': {       'target': 'https://localhost:8000',       'secure': false     }   } } ```  This functionality is implemented as a *transparent proxy* hence a request to `http://localhost:7357/api/posts.json` will be proxied to `http://localhost:4200/api/posts.json` without removing the `/api` prefix. Other available options can be found here: https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy#options  To limit the functionality to only certain content types, use 'onlyContentTypes'.

Until that gets resolved, I've made a [workaround](https://github.com/airportyh/mocha/tree/windowsfix) for mocha. To install this fork of Mocha, do          npm install https://github.com/airportyh/mocha/tarball/windowsfix -g  2. If you are using prototype.js version 1.6.3 or below, you will [encounter issues](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/issues/130).  Contributing ------------  If you want to [contribute to the project](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), I am going to do my best to stay out of your way.  Roadmap -------  1. [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/user/dashboard) integration - following [Bunyip](http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/bunyip)'s example 2. Figure out a happy path for testing on mobile browsers (maybe BrowserStack).

"tmp@0.0.24","https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp","MIT","# Tmp  A simple temporary file and directory creator for [node.js.][1]  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/raszi/node-tmp.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/raszi/node-tmp)  ## About  The main difference between bruce's [node-temp][2] is that mine more aggressively checks for the existence of the newly created temporary file and creates the new file with `O_EXCL` instead of simple `O_CREAT | O_RDRW`, so it is safer.  The API is slightly different as well, Tmp does not yet provide synchronous calls and all the parameters are optional.  You can set whether you want to remove the temporary file on process exit or not, and the destination directory can also be set.  ## How to install  ```bash npm install tmp ```  ## Usage  ### File creation  Simple temporary file creation, the file will be unlinked on process exit.  ```javascript var tmp = require('tmp');  tmp.file(function _tempFileCreated(err, path, fd) {   if (err) throw err;    console.log('File: ', path);   console.log('Filedescriptor: ', fd); }); ```  ### Directory creation  Simple temporary directory creation, it will be removed on process exit.  If the directory still contains items on process exit, then it won't be removed.  ```javascript var tmp = require('tmp');  tmp.dir(function _tempDirCreated(err, path) {   if (err) throw err;    console.log('Dir: ', path); }); ```  If you want to cleanup the directory even when there are entries in it, then you can pass the `unsafeCleanup` option when creating it.  ### Filename generation  It is possible with this library to generate a unique filename in the specified directory.  ```javascript var tmp = require('tmp');  tmp.tmpName(function _tempNameGenerated(err, path) {     if (err) throw err;      console.log('Created temporary filename: ', path); }); ```  ## Advanced usage  ### File creation  Creates a file with mode `0644`, prefix will be `prefix-` and postfix will be `.txt`.  ```javascript var tmp = require('tmp');  tmp.file({ mode: 0644, prefix: 'prefix-', postfix: '.txt' }, function _tempFileCreated(err, path, fd) {   if (err) throw err;    console.log('File: ', path);   console.log('Filedescriptor: ', fd); }); ```  ### Directory creation  Creates a directory with mode `0755`, prefix will be `myTmpDir_`.  ```javascript var tmp = require('tmp');  tmp.dir({ mode: 0750, prefix: 'myTmpDir_' }, function _tempDirCreated(err, path) {   if (err) throw err;    console.log('Dir: ', path); }); ```  ### mkstemps like  Creates a new temporary directory with mode `0700` and filename like `/tmp/tmp-nk2J1u`.  ```javascript var tmp = require('tmp');  tmp.dir({ template: '/tmp/tmp-XXXXXX' }, function _tempDirCreated(err, path) {   if (err) throw err;    console.log('Dir: ', path); }); ```  ### Filename generation  The `tmpName()` function accepts the `prefix`, `postfix`, `dir`, etc. parameters also:  ```javascript var tmp = require('tmp');  tmp.tmpName({ template: '/tmp/tmp-XXXXXX' }, function _tempNameGenerated(err, path) {     if (err) throw err;      console.log('Created temporary filename: ', path); }); ```  ## Graceful cleanup  One may want to cleanup the temporary files even when an uncaught exception occurs. To enforce this, you can call the `setGracefulCleanup()` method:  ```javascript var tmp = require('tmp');  tmp.setGracefulCleanup(); ```  ## Options  All options are optional :)    * `mode`: the file mode to create with, it fallbacks to `0600` on file creation and `0700` on directory creation   * `prefix`: the optional prefix, fallbacks to `tmp-` if not provided   * `postfix`: the optional postfix, fallbacks to `.tmp` on file creation   * `template`: [`mkstemps`][3] like filename template, no default   * `dir`: the optional temporary directory, fallbacks to system default (guesses from environment)   * `tries`: how many times should the function try to get a unique filename before giving up, default `3`   * `keep`: signals that the temporary file or directory should not be deleted on exit, default is `false`, means delete   * `unsafeCleanup`: recursively removes the created temporary directory, even when it's not empty. default is `false`  [1]: http://nodejs.org/ [2]: https://github.com/bruce/node-temp [3]: http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/mkstemp.3.html"

It is developed on <a href='http://nodejs.org/'>NodeJS</a>, but it should work on any JavaScript platform supporting the CommonJS module system (and if your platform of choice doesn't support CommonJS, you can easily implement it, or discard the <code>exports.*</code> lines from UglifyJS sources). </p> <p> The tokenizer/parser generates an abstract syntax tree from JS code.  You can then traverse the AST to learn more about the code, or do various manipulations on it.  This part is implemented in <a href='../lib/parse-js.js'>parse-js.js</a> and it's a port to JavaScript of the excellent <a href='http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/parse-js/'>parse-js</a> Common Lisp library from <a href='http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/'>Marijn Haverbeke</a>. </p> <p> ( See <a href='http://github.com/mishoo/cl-uglify-js'>cl-uglify-js</a> if you're looking for the Common Lisp version of UglifyJS. ) </p> <p> The second part of this package, implemented in <a href='../lib/process.js'>process.js</a>, inspects and manipulates the AST generated by the parser to provide the following: </p> <ul> <li> ability to re-generate JavaScript code from the AST.  Optionally indented&mdash;you can use this if you want to “beautify” a program that has been compressed, so that you can inspect the source.  But you can also run our code generator to print out an AST without any whitespace, so you achieve compression as well.  </li> <li> shorten variable names (usually to single characters).  Our mangler will analyze the code and generate proper variable names, depending on scope and usage, and is smart enough to deal with globals defined elsewhere, or with <code>eval()</code> calls or <code>with{}</code> statements.  In short, if <code>eval()</code> or <code>with{}</code> are used in some scope, then all variables in that scope and any variables in the parent scopes will remain unmangled, and any references to such variables remain unmangled as well.  </li> <li> various small optimizations that may lead to faster code but certainly lead to smaller code.  Where possible, we do the following:  <ul> <li> foo['bar']  ==&gt;  foo.bar  </li> <li> remove block brackets <code>{}</code>  </li> <li> join consecutive var declarations: var a = 10; var b = 20; ==&gt; var a=10,b=20;  </li> <li> resolve simple constant expressions: 1 +2 * 3 ==&gt; 7.  We only do the replacement if the result occupies less bytes; for example 1/3 would translate to 0.333333333333, so in this case we don't replace it.  </li> <li> consecutive statements in blocks are merged into a sequence; in many cases, this leaves blocks with a single statement, so then we can remove the block brackets.  </li> <li> various optimizations for IF statements:  <ul> <li> if (foo) bar(); else baz(); ==&gt; foo?bar():baz(); </li> <li> if (!foo) bar(); else baz(); ==&gt; foo?baz():bar(); </li> <li> if (foo) bar(); ==&gt; foo&amp;&amp;bar(); </li> <li> if (!foo) bar(); ==&gt; foo||bar(); </li> <li> if (foo) return bar(); else return baz(); ==&gt; return foo?bar():baz(); </li> <li> if (foo) return bar(); else something(); ==&gt; {if(foo)return bar();something()}  </li> </ul> </li> <li> remove some unreachable code and warn about it (code that follows a <code>return</code>, <code>throw</code>, <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> statement, except function/variable declarations).  </li> <li> act a limited version of a pre-processor (c.f. the pre-processor of C/C++) to allow you to safely replace selected global symbols with specified values.  When combined with the optimisations above this can make UglifyJS operate slightly more like a compilation process, in that when certain symbols are replaced by constant values, entire code blocks may be optimised away as unreachable. </li> </ul> </li> </ul>    </div>  <div id='outline-container-1_1' class='outline-3'> <h3 id='sec-1_1'><span class='section-number-3'>1.1</span> <span class='target'>Unsafe transformations</span>  </h3> <div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1_1'>   <p> The following transformations can in theory break code, although they're probably safe in most practical cases.

(the output is always encoded in UTF8, but if you pass this option you'll only get ASCII).  </li> <li> <code>-nm</code> or <code>--no-mangle</code> &mdash; don't mangle variable names  </li> <li> <code>-ns</code> or <code>--no-squeeze</code> &mdash; don't call <code>ast_squeeze()</code> (which does various optimizations that result in smaller, less readable code).  </li> <li> <code>-mt</code> or <code>--mangle-toplevel</code> &mdash; mangle names in the toplevel scope too (by default we don't do this).  </li> <li> <code>--no-seqs</code> &mdash; when <code>ast_squeeze()</code> is called (thus, unless you pass <code>--no-squeeze</code>) it will reduce consecutive statements in blocks into a sequence.  For example, 'a = 10; b = 20; foo();' will be written as 'a=10,b=20,foo();'.  In various occasions, this allows us to discard the block brackets (since the block becomes a single statement).  This is ON by default because it seems safe and saves a few hundred bytes on some libs that I tested it on, but pass <code>--no-seqs</code> to disable it.  </li> <li> <code>--no-dead-code</code> &mdash; by default, UglifyJS will remove code that is obviously unreachable (code that follows a <code>return</code>, <code>throw</code>, <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> statement and is not a function/variable declaration).  Pass this option to disable this optimization.  </li> <li> <code>-nc</code> or <code>--no-copyright</code> &mdash; by default, <code>uglifyjs</code> will keep the initial comment tokens in the generated code (assumed to be copyright information etc.).  If you pass this it will discard it.  </li> <li> <code>-o filename</code> or <code>--output filename</code> &mdash; put the result in <code>filename</code>.  If this isn't given, the result goes to standard output (or see next one).  </li> <li> <code>--overwrite</code> &mdash; if the code is read from a file (not from STDIN) and you pass <code>--overwrite</code> then the output will be written in the same file.  </li> <li> <code>--ast</code> &mdash; pass this if you want to get the Abstract Syntax Tree instead of JavaScript as output.  Useful for debugging or learning more about the internals.  </li> <li> <code>-v</code> or <code>--verbose</code> &mdash; output some notes on STDERR (for now just how long each operation takes).  </li> <li> <code>-d SYMBOL[=VALUE]</code> or <code>--define SYMBOL[=VALUE]</code> &mdash; will replace all instances of the specified symbol where used as an identifier (except where symbol has properly declared by a var declaration or use as function parameter or similar) with the specified value. This argument may be specified multiple times to define multiple symbols - if no value is specified the symbol will be replaced with the value <code>true</code>, or you can specify a numeric value (such as <code>1024</code>), a quoted string value (such as ='object'= or ='https://github.com'<code>), or the name of another symbol or keyword   (such as =null</code> or <code>document</code>).   This allows you, for example, to assign meaningful names to key constant values but discard the symbolic names in the uglified version for brevity/efficiency, or when used wth care, allows UglifyJS to operate as a form of <b>conditional compilation</b> whereby defining appropriate values may, by dint of the constant folding and dead code removal features above, remove entire superfluous code blocks (e.g. completely remove instrumentation or trace code for production use). Where string values are being defined, the handling of quotes are likely to be subject to the specifics of your command shell environment, so you may need to experiment with quoting styles depending on your platform, or you may find the option <code>--define-from-module</code> more suitable for use.  </li> <li> <code>-define-from-module SOMEMODULE</code> &mdash; will load the named module (as per the NodeJS <code>require()</code> function) and iterate all the exported properties of the module defining them as symbol names to be defined (as if by the <code>--define</code> option) per the name of each property (i.e. without the module name prefix) and given the value of the property. This is a much easier way to handle and document groups of symbols to be defined rather than a large number of <code>--define</code> options.  </li> <li> <code>--unsafe</code> &mdash; enable other additional optimizations that are known to be unsafe in some contrived situations, but could still be generally useful. For now only these:  <ul> <li> foo.toString()  ==&gt;  foo+'' </li> <li> new Array(x,&hellip;)  ==&gt; [x,&hellip;] </li> <li> new Array(x) ==&gt; Array(x)  </li> </ul> </li> <li> <code>--max-line-len</code> (default 32K characters) &mdash; add a newline after around 32K characters.  I've seen both FF and Chrome croak when all the code was on a single line of around 670K.  Pass &ndash;max-line-len 0 to disable this safety feature.  </li> <li> <code>--reserved-names</code> &mdash; some libraries rely on certain names to be used, as pointed out in issue #92 and #81, so this option allow you to exclude such names from the mangler.  For example, to keep names <code>require</code> and <code>$super</code> intact you'd specify &ndash;reserved-names 'require,$super'.  </li> <li> <code>--inline-script</code> &ndash; when you want to include the output literally in an HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag you can use this option to prevent <code>&lt;/script</code> from showing up in the output.  </li> <li> <code>--lift-vars</code> &ndash; when you pass this, UglifyJS will apply the following transformations (see the notes in API, <code>ast_lift_variables</code>):  <ul> <li> put all <code>var</code> declarations at the start of the scope </li> <li> make sure a variable is declared only once </li> <li> discard unused function arguments </li> <li> discard unused inner (named) functions </li> <li> finally, try to merge assignments into that one <code>var</code> declaration, if possible. </li> </ul> </li> </ul>    </div>  <div id='outline-container-1_4_1' class='outline-4'> <h4 id='sec-1_4_1'><span class='section-number-4'>1.4.1</span> API </h4> <div class='outline-text-4' id='text-1_4_1'>   <p> To use the library from JavaScript, you'd do the following (example for NodeJS): </p>    <pre class='src src-js'><span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>jsp</span> = require(<span style='color: #bc8f8f;'>'uglify-js'</span>).parser; <span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>pro</span> = require(<span style='color: #bc8f8f;'>'uglify-js'</span>).uglify;  <span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>orig_code</span> = <span style='color: #bc8f8f;'>'... JS code here'</span>; <span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>ast</span> = jsp.parse(orig_code); <span style='color: #b22222;'>// </span><span style='color: #b22222;'>parse code and get the initial AST </span>ast = pro.ast_mangle(ast); <span style='color: #b22222;'>// </span><span style='color: #b22222;'>get a new AST with mangled names </span>ast = pro.ast_squeeze(ast); <span style='color: #b22222;'>// </span><span style='color: #b22222;'>get an AST with compression optimizations </span><span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>final_code</span> = pro.gen_code(ast); <span style='color: #b22222;'>// </span><span style='color: #b22222;'>compressed code here </span></pre>    <p> The above performs the full compression that is possible right now.  As you can see, there are a sequence of steps which you can apply.  For example if you want compressed output but for some reason you don't want to mangle variable names, you would simply skip the line that calls <code>pro.ast_mangle(ast)</code>. </p> <p> Some of these functions take optional arguments.  Here's a description: </p> <ul> <li> <code>jsp.parse(code, strict_semicolons)</code> &ndash; parses JS code and returns an AST. <code>strict_semicolons</code> is optional and defaults to <code>false</code>.  If you pass <code>true</code> then the parser will throw an error when it expects a semicolon and it doesn't find it.  For most JS code you don't want that, but it's useful if you want to strictly sanitize your code.  </li> <li> <code>pro.ast_lift_variables(ast)</code> &ndash; merge and move <code>var</code> declarations to the scop of the scope; discard unused function arguments or variables; discard unused (named) inner functions.  It also tries to merge assignments following the <code>var</code> declaration into it.  <p> If your code is very hand-optimized concerning <code>var</code> declarations, this lifting variable declarations might actually increase size.  For me it helps out.  On jQuery it adds 865 bytes (243 after gzip).  YMMV.  Also note that (since it's not enabled by default) this operation isn't yet heavily tested (please report if you find issues!). </p> <p> Note that although it might increase the image size (on jQuery it gains 865 bytes, 243 after gzip) it's technically more correct: in certain situations, dead code removal might drop variable declarations, which would not happen if the variables are lifted in advance. </p> <p> Here's an example of what it does: </p> </li> </ul>     <pre class='src src-js'><span style='color: #a020f0;'>function</span> <span style='color: #0000ff;'>f</span>(<span style='color: #b8860b;'>a</span>, <span style='color: #b8860b;'>b</span>, <span style='color: #b8860b;'>c</span>, <span style='color: #b8860b;'>d</span>, <span style='color: #b8860b;'>e</span>) {     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>q</span>;     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>w</span>;     w = 10;     q = 20;     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>for</span> (<span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>i</span> = 1; i &lt; 10; ++i) {         <span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>boo</span> = foo(a);     }     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>for</span> (<span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>i</span> = 0; i &lt; 1; ++i) {         <span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>boo</span> = bar(c);     }     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>function</span> <span style='color: #0000ff;'>foo</span>(){ ... }     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>function</span> <span style='color: #0000ff;'>bar</span>(){ ... }     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>function</span> <span style='color: #0000ff;'>baz</span>(){ ... } }  <span style='color: #b22222;'>// </span><span style='color: #b22222;'>transforms into ==&gt; </span> <span style='color: #a020f0;'>function</span> <span style='color: #0000ff;'>f</span>(<span style='color: #b8860b;'>a</span>, <span style='color: #b8860b;'>b</span>, <span style='color: #b8860b;'>c</span>) {     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>var</span> <span style='color: #b8860b;'>i</span>, <span style='color: #b8860b;'>boo</span>, <span style='color: #b8860b;'>w</span> = 10, <span style='color: #b8860b;'>q</span> = 20;     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>for</span> (i = 1; i &lt; 10; ++i) {         boo = foo(a);     }     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>for</span> (i = 0; i &lt; 1; ++i) {         boo = bar(c);     }     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>function</span> <span style='color: #0000ff;'>foo</span>() { ... }     <span style='color: #a020f0;'>function</span> <span style='color: #0000ff;'>bar</span>() { ... } } </pre>    <ul> <li> <code>pro.ast_mangle(ast, options)</code> &ndash; generates a new AST containing mangled (compressed) variable and function names.  It supports the following options:  <ul> <li> <code>toplevel</code> &ndash; mangle toplevel names (by default we don't touch them). </li> <li> <code>except</code> &ndash; an array of names to exclude from compression. </li> <li> <code>defines</code> &ndash; an object with properties named after symbols to replace (see the <code>--define</code> option for the script) and the values representing the AST replacement value.  </li> </ul> </li> <li> <code>pro.ast_squeeze(ast, options)</code> &ndash; employs further optimizations designed to reduce the size of the code that <code>gen_code</code> would generate from the AST.  Returns a new AST.  <code>options</code> can be a hash; the supported options are:  <ul> <li> <code>make_seqs</code> (default true) which will cause consecutive statements in a block to be merged using the 'sequence' (comma) operator  </li> <li> <code>dead_code</code> (default true) which will remove unreachable code.  </li> </ul> </li> <li> <code>pro.gen_code(ast, options)</code> &ndash; generates JS code from the AST.  By default it's minified, but using the <code>options</code> argument you can get nicely formatted output.  <code>options</code> is, well, optional :-) and if you pass it it must be an object and supports the following properties (below you can see the default values):  <ul> <li> <code>beautify: false</code> &ndash; pass <code>true</code> if you want indented output </li> <li> <code>indent_start: 0</code> (only applies when <code>beautify</code> is <code>true</code>) &ndash; initial indentation in spaces </li> <li> <code>indent_level: 4</code> (only applies when <code>beautify</code> is <code>true</code>) -- indentation level, in spaces (pass an even number) </li> <li> <code>quote_keys: false</code> &ndash; if you pass <code>true</code> it will quote all keys in literal objects </li> <li> <code>space_colon: false</code> (only applies when <code>beautify</code> is <code>true</code>) &ndash; wether to put a space before the colon in object literals </li> <li> <code>ascii_only: false</code> &ndash; pass <code>true</code> if you want to encode non-ASCII characters as <code>\uXXXX</code>. </li> <li> <code>inline_script: false</code> &ndash; pass <code>true</code> to escape occurrences of <code>&lt;/script</code> in strings </li> </ul> </li> </ul>   </div>  </div>  <div id='outline-container-1_4_2' class='outline-4'> <h4 id='sec-1_4_2'><span class='section-number-4'>1.4.2</span> Beautifier shortcoming &ndash; no more comments </h4> <div class='outline-text-4' id='text-1_4_2'>   <p> The beautifier can be used as a general purpose indentation tool.

Similarly, within <code>CLAUSE2</code> both calls to <code>console.log()</code> will be removed altogether. </p> <p> In this way you can mimic, to a limited degree, the functionality of the C/C++ pre-processor to enable or completely remove blocks depending on how certain symbols are defined - perhaps using UglifyJS to generate different versions of source aimed at different environments </p> <p> It is recommmended (but not made mandatory) that symbols designed for this purpose are given names consisting of <code>UPPER_CASE_LETTERS</code> to distinguish them from other (normal) symbols and avoid the sort of clash that <code>CLAUSE3</code> above illustrates. </p> </div> </div>  </div>  <div id='outline-container-1_5' class='outline-3'> <h3 id='sec-1_5'><span class='section-number-3'>1.5</span> Compression &ndash; how good is it? </h3> <div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1_5'>   <p> Here are updated statistics.

"underscore.string@2.3.3","https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string","MIT","# Underscore.string [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/epeli/underscore.string.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/epeli/underscore.string) #    Javascript lacks complete string manipulation operations. This an attempt to fill that gap. List of build-in methods can be found for example from [Dive Into JavaScript][d].  [d]: http://www.diveintojavascript.com/core-javascript-reference/the-string-object   As name states this an extension for [Underscore.js][u], but it can be used independently from **_s**-global variable. But with Underscore.js you can use Object-Oriented style and chaining:  [u]: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/  ```javascript _('   epeli  ').chain().trim().capitalize().value() => 'Epeli' ```  ## Download ##    * [Development version](https://raw.github.com/epeli/underscore.string/master/lib/underscore.string.js) *Uncompressed with Comments 18kb*   * [Production version](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/raw/master/dist/underscore.string.min.js) *Minified 7kb*   ## Node.js installation ##  **npm package**      npm install underscore.string  **Standalone usage**:  ```javascript var _s = require('underscore.string'); ```  **Integrate with Underscore.js**:  ```javascript var _  = require('underscore');  // Import Underscore.string to separate object, because there are conflict functions (include, reverse, contains) _.str = require('underscore.string');  // Mix in non-conflict functions to Underscore namespace if you want _.mixin(_.str.exports());  // All functions, include conflict, will be available through _.str object _.str.include('Underscore.string', 'string'); // => true ```  **Or Integrate with Underscore.js without module loading**  Run the following expression after Underscore.js and Underscore.string are loaded ```javascript // _.str becomes a global variable if no module loading is detected // Mix in non-conflict functions to Underscore namespace _.mixin(_.str.exports()); ```  ## String Functions ##  For availability of functions in this way you need to mix in Underscore.string functions:  ```javascript _.mixin(_.string.exports()); ```  otherwise functions from examples will be available through _.string or _.str objects:  ```javascript _.str.capitalize('epeli') => 'Epeli' ```  **numberFormat** _.numberFormat(number, [ decimals=0, decimalSeparator='.', orderSeparator=','])  Formats the numbers.  ```javascript _.numberFormat(1000, 2) => '1,000.00'  _.numberFormat(123456789.123, 5, '.', ',') => '123,456,789.12300' ```   **levenshtein** _.levenshtein(string1, string2)  Calculates [Levenshtein distance][ld] between two strings. [ld]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance  ```javascript _.levenshtein('kitten', 'kittah') => 2 ```  **capitalize** _.capitalize(string)  Converts first letter of the string to uppercase.  ```javascript _.capitalize('foo Bar') => 'Foo Bar' ```  **chop** _.chop(string, step)  ```javascript _.chop('whitespace', 3) => ['whi','tes','pac','e'] ```  **clean** _.clean(str)  Compress some whitespaces to one.  ```javascript _.clean(' foo    bar   ') => 'foo bar' ```  **chars** _.chars(str)  ```javascript _.chars('Hello') => ['H','e','l','l','o'] ```  **swapCase** _.swapCase(str)  Returns a copy of the string in which all the case-based characters have had their case swapped.  ```javascript _.swapCase('hELLO') => 'Hello' ```  **include** available only through _.str object, because Underscore has function with the same name.  ```javascript _.str.include('foobar', 'ob') => true ```  (removed) **includes** _.includes(string, substring)  Tests if string contains a substring.  ```javascript _.includes('foobar', 'ob') => true ```  **includes** function was removed  But you can create it in this way, for compatibility with previous versions:  ```javascript _.includes = _.str.include ```  **count** _.count(string, substring)  ```javascript _('Hello world').count('l') => 3 ```  **escapeHTML** _.escapeHTML(string)  Converts HTML special characters to their entity equivalents.  ```javascript _('<div>Blah blah blah</div>').escapeHTML(); => '&lt;div&gt;Blah blah blah&lt;/div&gt;' ```  **unescapeHTML** _.unescapeHTML(string)  Converts entity characters to HTML equivalents.  ```javascript _('&lt;div&gt;Blah blah blah&lt;/div&gt;').unescapeHTML(); => '<div>Blah blah blah</div>' ```  **insert** _.insert(string, index, substing)  ```javascript _('Hello ').insert(6, 'world') => 'Hello world' ```  **isBlank** _.isBlank(string)  ```javascript _('').isBlank(); // => true _('\n').isBlank(); // => true _(' ').isBlank(); // => true _('a').isBlank(); // => false ```  **join** _.join(separator, *strings)  Joins strings together with given separator  ```javascript _.join(' ', 'foo', 'bar') => 'foo bar' ```  **lines** _.lines(str)  ```javascript _.lines('Hello\nWorld') => ['Hello', 'World'] ```  **reverse** available only through _.str object, because Underscore has function with the same name.  Return reversed string:  ```javascript _.str.reverse('foobar') => 'raboof' ```  **splice**  _.splice(string, index, howmany, substring)  Like a array splice.  ```javascript _('https://edtsech@bitbucket.org/edtsech/underscore.strings').splice(30, 7, 'epeli') => 'https://edtsech@bitbucket.org/epeli/underscore.strings' ```  **startsWith** _.startsWith(string, starts)  This method checks whether string starts with starts.  ```javascript _('image.gif').startsWith('image') => true ```  **endsWith** _.endsWith(string, ends)  This method checks whether string ends with ends.  ```javascript _('image.gif').endsWith('gif') => true ```  **succ**  _.succ(str)  Returns the successor to str.  ```javascript _('a').succ() => 'b'  _('A').succ() => 'B' ```  **supplant**  Supplant function was removed, use Underscore.js [template function][p].  [p]: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#template  **strip** alias for *trim*  **lstrip** alias for *ltrim*  **rstrip** alias for *rtrim*  **titleize** _.titleize(string)  ```javascript _('my name is epeli').titleize() => 'My Name Is Epeli' ```  **camelize** _.camelize(string)  Converts underscored or dasherized string to a camelized one  ```javascript _('-moz-transform').camelize() => 'MozTransform' ```  **classify** _.classify(string)  Converts string to camelized class name  ```javascript _('some_class_name').classify() => 'SomeClassName' ```  **underscored** _.underscored(string)  Converts a camelized or dasherized string into an underscored one  ```javascript _('MozTransform').underscored() => 'moz_transform' ```  **dasherize** _.dasherize(string)  Converts a underscored or camelized string into an dasherized one  ```javascript _('MozTransform').dasherize() => '-moz-transform' ```  **humanize** _.humanize(string)  Converts an underscored, camelized, or dasherized string into a humanized one. Also removes beginning and ending whitespace, and removes the postfix '_id'.  ```javascript _('  capitalize dash-CamelCase_underscore trim  ').humanize() => 'Capitalize dash camel case underscore trim' ```  **trim** _.trim(string, [characters])  trims defined characters from begining and ending of the string. Defaults to whitespace characters.  ```javascript _.trim('  foobar   ') => 'foobar'  _.trim('_-foobar-_', '_-') => 'foobar' ```   **ltrim** _.ltrim(string, [characters])  Left trim. Similar to trim, but only for left side.   **rtrim** _.rtrim(string, [characters])  Right trim. Similar to trim, but only for right side.  **truncate** _.truncate(string, length, truncateString)  ```javascript _('Hello world').truncate(5) => 'Hello...'  _('Hello').truncate(10) => 'Hello' ```  **prune** _.prune(string, length, pruneString)  Elegant version of truncate. Makes sure the pruned string does not exceed the original length. Avoid half-chopped words when truncating.  ```javascript _('Hello, world').prune(5) => 'Hello...'  _('Hello, world').prune(8) => 'Hello...'  _('Hello, world').prune(5, ' (read a lot more)') => 'Hello, world' (as adding '(read a lot more)' would be longer than the original string)  _('Hello, cruel world').prune(15) => 'Hello, cruel...'  _('Hello').prune(10) => 'Hello' ```  **words** _.words(str, delimiter=/\s+/)  Split string by delimiter (String or RegExp), /\s+/ by default.  ```javascript _.words('   I   love   you   ') => ['I','love','you']  _.words('I_love_you', '_') => ['I','love','you']  _.words('I-love-you', /-/) => ['I','love','you']  _.words('   ') => [] ```  **sprintf** _.sprintf(string format, *arguments)  C like string formatting. Credits goes to [Alexandru Marasteanu][o]. For more detailed documentation, see the [original page][o].  [o]: http://www.diveintojavascript.com/projects/sprintf-for-javascript  ```javascript _.sprintf('%.1f', 1.17) '1.2' ```  **pad** _.pad(str, length, [padStr, type])  pads the `str` with characters until the total string length is equal to the passed `length` parameter. By default, pads on the **left** with the space char (`' '`). `padStr` is truncated to a single character if necessary.  ```javascript _.pad('1', 8) -> '       1';  _.pad('1', 8, '0') -> '00000001';  _.pad('1', 8, '0', 'right') -> '10000000';  _.pad('1', 8, '0', 'both') -> '00001000';  _.pad('1', 8, 'bleepblorp', 'both') -> 'bbbb1bbb'; ```  **lpad** _.lpad(str, length, [padStr])  left-pad a string. Alias for `pad(str, length, padStr, 'left')`  ```javascript _.lpad('1', 8, '0') -> '00000001'; ```  **rpad** _.rpad(str, length, [padStr])  right-pad a string. Alias for `pad(str, length, padStr, 'right')`  ```javascript _.rpad('1', 8, '0') -> '10000000'; ```  **lrpad** _.lrpad(str, length, [padStr])  left/right-pad a string.

Such as 'true', 'false', '1' and '0'. This function is case insensitive.  ```javascript _.toBoolean('true') => true _.toBoolean('FALSE') => false _.toBoolean('random') => undefined ```  It can be customized by giving arrays of truth and falsy value matcher as parameters. Matchers can be also RegExp objects.  ```javascript _.toBoolean('truthy', ['truthy'], ['falsy']) => true _.toBoolean('true only at start', [/^true/]) => true ```  ## Roadmap ##  Any suggestions or bug reports are welcome. Just email me or more preferably open an issue.  #### Problems  We lose two things for `include` and `reverse` methods from `_.string`:  * Calls like `_('foobar').include('bar')` aren't available; * Chaining isn't available too.  But if you need this functionality you can create aliases for conflict functions which will be convenient for you:  ```javascript _.mixin({     includeString: _.str.include,     reverseString: _.str.reverse })  // Now wrapper calls and chaining are available. _('foobar').chain().reverseString().includeString('rab').value() ```  #### Standalone Usage  If you are using Underscore.string without Underscore. You also have `_.string` namespace for it and `_.str` alias But of course you can just reassign `_` variable with `_.string`  ```javascript _ = _.string ```  ## Changelog ##  ### 2.3.3 ###  * Add `toBoolean` * Add `unquote` * Add quote char option to `quote` * Support dash-separated words in `titleize`  ### 2.3.2 ###  * Add `naturalCmp` * Bug fix to `camelize` * Add ă, ș, ț and ś to `slugify` * Doc updates * Add support for [component](http://component.io/) * [Full changelog](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/compare/v2.3.1...v2.3.2)  ### 2.3.1 ###  * Bug fixes to `escapeHTML`, `classify`, `substr` * Faster `count` * Documentation fixes * [Full changelog](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/compare/v2.3.0...v2.3.1)  ### 2.3.0 ###  * Added `numberformat` method * Added `levenshtein` method (Levenshtein distance calculation) * Added `swapCase` method * Changed default behavior of `words` method * Added `toSentenceSerial` method * Added `surround` and `quote` methods  ### 2.2.1 ###  * Same as 2.2.0 (2.2.0rc on npm) to fix some npm drama  ### 2.2.0 ###  * Capitalize method behavior changed * Various perfomance tweaks  ### 2.1.1###  * Fixed words method bug * Added classify method  ### 2.1.0 ###  * AMD support * Added toSentence method * Added slugify method * Lots of speed optimizations  ### 2.0.0 ###  * Added prune, humanize functions * Added _.string (_.str) namespace for Underscore.string library * Removed includes function  For upgrading to this version you need to mix in Underscore.string library to Underscore object:  ```javascript _.mixin(_.string.exports()); ```  and all non-conflict Underscore.string functions will be available through Underscore object.

"underscore.string@3.3.4","https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string","MIT","<span class='github-only'>  The stable release documentation can be found here https://epeli.github.io/underscore.string/  </span>  # Underscore.string [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/epeli/underscore.string.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/epeli/underscore.string) #  Javascript lacks complete string manipulation operations. This is an attempt to fill that gap. List of build-in methods can be found for example from [Dive Into JavaScript][d]. Originally started as an Underscore.js extension but is a full standalone library nowadays.  Upgrading from 2.x to 3.x? Please read the [changelog][c].  [c]: https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/blob/master/CHANGELOG.markdown#300  ## Usage  ### For Node.js, Browserify and Webpack  Install from npm      npm install underscore.string  Require individual functions  ```javascript var slugify = require('underscore.string/slugify');  slugify('Hello world!'); // => hello-world ```  or load the full library to enable chaining  ```javascript var s = require('underscore.string');  s('   epeli  ').trim().capitalize().value(); // => 'Epeli' ```  but especially when using with [Browserify][] the individual function approach is recommended because using it you only add those functions to your bundle you use.  [Browserify]: http://browserify.org/  ### In Meteor  From your [Meteor][] project folder  ```shell     meteor add underscorestring:underscore.string ```  and you'll be able to access the library with the ***s*** global from both the server and the client.  ```javascript s.slugify('Hello world!'); // => hello-world  s('   epeli  ').trim().capitalize().value(); // => 'Epeli' ```  [Meteor]: http://www.meteor.com/  ### Others  The `dist/underscore.string.js` file is an [UMD][] build. You can load it using an AMD loader such as [RequireJS][] or just stick it to a web page and access the library from the ***s*** global.  [UMD]: https://github.com/umdjs/umd [RequireJS]: http://requirejs.org/  ### Underscore.js/Lo-Dash integration  It is still possible use as Underscore.js/Lo-Dash extension  ```javascript _.mixin(s.exports()); ``` But it's not recommended since `include`, `contains`, `reverse` and `join` are dropped because they collide with the functions already defined by Underscore.js.  ### Lo-Dash-FP/Ramda integration  If you want to use underscore.string with [ramdajs](http://ramdajs.com/) or [Lo-Dash-FP](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-fp) you can use [underscore.string.fp](https://github.com/stoeffel/underscore.string.fp).      npm install underscore.string.fp  ```javascript var S = require('underscore.string.fp'); var filter = require('lodash-fp').filter; var filter = require('ramda').filter;  filter(S.startsWith('.'), [   '.vimrc',   'foo.md',   '.zshrc' ]); // => ['.vimrc', '.zshrc'] ```  ## Download      * [Development version](https://npmcdn.com/underscore.string/dist/underscore.string.js) *Uncompressed with Comments*   * [Production version](https://npmcdn.com/underscore.string/dist/underscore.string.min.js) *Minified*  ## API  ### Individual functions  #### numberFormat(number, [ decimals=0, decimalSeparator='.', orderSeparator=',']) => string  Formats the numbers.  ```javascript numberFormat(1000, 2); // => '1,000.00'  numberFormat(123456789.123, 5, '.', ','); // => '123,456,789.12300' ```   #### levenshtein(string1, string2) => number  Calculates [Levenshtein distance][ld] between two strings. [ld]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance  ```javascript levenshtein('kitten', 'kittah'); // => 2 ```  #### capitalize(string, [lowercaseRest=false]) => string  Converts first letter of the string to uppercase. If `true` is passed as second argument the rest of the string will be converted to lower case.  ```javascript capitalize('foo Bar'); // => 'Foo Bar'  capitalize('FOO Bar', true); // => 'Foo bar' ```  #### decapitalize(string) => string  Converts first letter of the string to lowercase.  ```javascript decapitalize('Foo Bar'); // => 'foo Bar' ```  #### chop(string, step) => array  ```javascript chop('whitespace', 3); // => ['whi', 'tes', 'pac', 'e'] ```  #### clean(string) => string  Trim and replace multiple spaces with a single space.  ```javascript clean(' foo    bar   '); // => 'foo bar' ```  #### cleanDiacritics(string) => string  Replace [diacritic][dc] characters with closest ASCII equivalents. Check the [source][s] for supported characters. [Pull requests][p] welcome for missing characters!  [dc]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic [s]: https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/blob/master/cleanDiacritics.js [p]: https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.markdown  ```javascript cleanDiacritics('ääkkönen'); // => 'aakkonen' ```  #### chars(string) => array  ```javascript chars('Hello'); // => ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'] ```  #### swapCase(string) => string  Returns a copy of the string in which all the case-based characters have had their case swapped.  ```javascript swapCase('hELLO'); // => 'Hello' ```  #### include(string, substring) => boolean  Tests if string contains a substring.  ```javascript include('foobar', 'ob'); // => true ```  #### count(string, substring) => number  Returns number of occurrences of substring in string.  ```javascript count('Hello world', 'l'); // => 3 ```  #### escapeHTML(string) => string  Converts HTML special characters to their entity equivalents. This function supports cent, yen, euro, pound, lt, gt, copy, reg, quote, amp, apos.  ```javascript escapeHTML('<div>Blah blah blah</div>'); // => '&lt;div&gt;Blah blah blah&lt;/div&gt;' ```  #### unescapeHTML(string) => string  Converts entity characters to HTML equivalents. This function supports cent, yen, euro, pound, lt, gt, copy, reg, quote, amp, apos, nbsp.  ```javascript unescapeHTML('&lt;div&gt;Blah&nbsp;blah blah&lt;/div&gt;'); // => '<div>Blah blah blah</div>' ```  #### insert(string, index, substring) => string  ```javascript insert('Hellworld', 4, 'o '); // => 'Hello world' ```  #### replaceAll(string, find, replace, [ignorecase=false]) => string  ```javascript replaceAll('foo', 'o', 'a'); // => 'faa' ```  #### isBlank(string) => boolean  ```javascript isBlank(''); // => true isBlank('\n'); // => true isBlank(' '); // => true isBlank('a'); // => false ```  #### join(separator, ...strings) => string  Joins strings together with given separator  ```javascript join(' ', 'foo', 'bar'); // => 'foo bar' ```  #### lines(str) => array  Split lines to an array  ```javascript lines('Hello\nWorld'); // => ['Hello', 'World'] ```  #### wrap(str, options) => string  Splits a line `str` (default '') into several lines of size `options.width` (default 75) using a `options.seperator` (default '\n'). If `options.trailingSpaces` is true, make each line at least `width` long using trailing spaces. If `options.cut` is true, create new lines in the middle of words. If `options.preserveSpaces` is true, preserve the space that should be there at the end of a line (only works if options.cut is false).  ```javascript wrap('Hello World', { width:5 }) // => 'Hello\nWorld'  wrap('Hello World', { width:6, seperator:'.', trailingSpaces: true }) // => 'Hello .World '  wrap('Hello World', { width:5, seperator:'.', cut:true, trailingSpaces: true }) // => 'Hello. Worl.d    '  wrap('Hello World', { width:5, seperator:'.', preserveSpaces: true }) // => 'Hello .World'  ```  #### dedent(str, [pattern]) => string  Dedent unnecessary indentation or dedent by a pattern.  Credits go to @sindresorhus. This implementation is similar to https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-indent  ```javascript dedent('  Hello\n    World'); // => 'Hello\n  World'  dedent('\t\tHello\n\t\t\t\tWorld'); // => 'Hello\n\t\tWorld'  dedent('    Hello\n    World', '  '); // Dedent by 2 spaces // => '  Hello\n  World' ```  #### reverse(string) => string  Return reversed string:  ```javascript reverse('foobar'); // => 'raboof' ```  #### splice(string, index, howmany, substring) => string  Like an array splice.  ```javascript splice('https://edtsech@bitbucket.org/edtsech/underscore.strings', 30, 7, 'epeli'); // => 'https://edtsech@bitbucket.org/epeli/underscore.strings' ```  #### startsWith(string, starts, [position]) => boolean  This method checks whether the string begins with `starts` at `position` (default: 0).  ```javascript startsWith('image.gif', 'image'); // => true  startsWith('.vimrc', 'vim', 1); // => true ```  #### endsWith(string, ends, [position]) => boolean  This method checks whether the string ends with `ends` at `position` (default: string.length).  ```javascript endsWith('image.gif', 'gif'); // => true  endsWith('image.old.gif', 'old', 9); // => true ```  #### pred(string) => string  Returns the predecessor to str.  ```javascript pred('b'); // => 'a'  pred('B'); // => 'A' ```  #### succ(string) => string  Returns the successor to str.  ```javascript succ('a'); // => 'b'  succ('A'); // => 'B' ```   #### titleize(string) => string  ```javascript titleize('my name is epeli'); // => 'My Name Is Epeli' ```  #### camelize(string, [decapitalize=false]) => string  Converts underscored or dasherized string to a camelized one. Begins with a lower case letter unless it starts with an underscore, dash or an upper case letter.  ```javascript camelize('moz-transform'); // => 'mozTransform'  camelize('-moz-transform'); // => 'MozTransform'  camelize('_moz_transform'); // => 'MozTransform'  camelize('Moz-transform'); // => 'MozTransform'  camelize('-moz-transform', true); // => 'mozTransform' ```  #### classify(string) => string  Converts string to camelized class name. First letter is always upper case  ```javascript classify('some_class_name'); // => 'SomeClassName' ```  #### underscored(string) => string  Converts a camelized or dasherized string into an underscored one  ```javascript underscored('MozTransform'); // => 'moz_transform' ```  #### dasherize(string) => string  Converts a underscored or camelized string into an dasherized one  ```javascript dasherize('MozTransform'); // => '-moz-transform' ```  #### humanize(string) => string  Converts an underscored, camelized, or dasherized string into a humanized one. Also removes beginning and ending whitespace, and removes the postfix '_id'.  ```javascript humanize('  capitalize dash-CamelCase_underscore trim  '); // => 'Capitalize dash camel case underscore trim' ```  #### trim(string, [characters]) => string  Trims defined characters from begining and ending of the string. Defaults to whitespace characters.  ```javascript trim('  foobar   '); // => 'foobar'  trim('_-foobar-_', '_-'); // => 'foobar' ```   #### ltrim(string, [characters]) => string  Left trim. Similar to trim, but only for left side.  #### rtrim(string, [characters]) => string  Right trim. Similar to trim, but only for right side.  #### truncate(string, length, [truncateString = '...']) => string  ```javascript truncate('Hello world', 5); // => 'Hello...'  truncate('Hello', 10); // => 'Hello' ```  #### prune(string, length, pruneString) => string  Elegant version of truncate.

Avoid half-chopped words when truncating.  ```javascript prune('Hello, world', 5); // => 'Hello...'  prune('Hello, world', 8); // => 'Hello...'  prune('Hello, world', 5, ' (read a lot more)'); // => 'Hello, world' (as adding '(read a lot more)' would be longer than the original string)  prune('Hello, cruel world', 15); // => 'Hello, cruel...'  prune('Hello', 10); // => 'Hello' ```  #### words(str, delimiter=/\s+/) => array  Split string by delimiter (String or RegExp), /\s+/ by default.  ```javascript words('   I   love   you   '); // => ['I', 'love', 'you']  words('I_love_you', '_'); // => ['I', 'love', 'you']  words('I-love-you', /-/); // => ['I', 'love', 'you']  words('   ') // => [] ```  #### sprintf(string format, ...arguments) => string  C like string formatting. Makes use of the [sprintf-js](https://npmjs.org/package/sprintf-js) package.  **This function will be removed in the next major release, use the [sprintf-js](https://npmjs.org/package/sprintf-js) package instead.**  ```javascript sprintf('%.1f', 1.17); // => '1.2' ```  #### pad(str, length, [padStr, type]) => string  pads the `str` with characters until the total string length is equal to the passed `length` parameter. By default, pads on the **left** with the space char (`' '`). `padStr` is truncated to a single character if necessary.  ```javascript pad('1', 8); // => '       1'  pad('1', 8, '0'); // => '00000001'  pad('1', 8, '0', 'right'); // => '10000000'  pad('1', 8, '0', 'both'); // => '00001000'  pad('1', 8, 'bleepblorp', 'both'); // => 'bbbb1bbb' ```  #### lpad(str, length, [padStr]) => string  left-pad a string.

Alias for `pad(str, length, padStr, 'both')`  ```javascript lrpad('1', 8, '0'); // => '00001000' ```   #### toNumber(string, [decimals]) => number  Parse string to number. Returns NaN if string can't be parsed to number.  ```javascript toNumber('2.556'); // => 3  toNumber('2.556', 1); // => 2.6  toNumber('999.999', -1); // => 990 ```  #### strRight(string, pattern) => string  Searches a string from left to right for a pattern and returns a substring consisting of the characters in the string that are to the right of the pattern or all string if no match found.  ```javascript strRight('This_is_a_test_string', '_'); // => 'is_a_test_string' ```  #### strRightBack(string, pattern) => string  Searches a string from right to left for a pattern and returns a substring consisting of the characters in the string that are to the right of the pattern or all string if no match found.  ```javascript strRightBack('This_is_a_test_string', '_'); // => 'string' ```  #### strLeft(string, pattern) => string  Searches a string from left to right for a pattern and returns a substring consisting of the characters in the string that are to the left of the pattern or all string if no match found.  ```javascript strLeft('This_is_a_test_string', '_'); // => 'This'; ```  #### strLeftBack(string, pattern) => string  Searches a string from right to left for a pattern and returns a substring consisting of the characters in the string that are to the left of the pattern or all string if no match found.  ```javascript strLeftBack('This_is_a_test_string', '_'); // => 'This_is_a_test'; ```  #### stripTags(string) => string  Removes all html tags from string.  ```javascript stripTags('a <a href=\'#\'>link</a>'); // => 'a link'  stripTags('a <a href=\'#\'>link</a><script>alert(\'hello world!\')</script>'); // => 'a linkalert('hello world!')' ```  #### toSentence(array, [delimiter, lastDelimiter]) => string  Join an array into a human readable sentence.  ```javascript toSentence(['jQuery', 'Mootools', 'Prototype']); // => 'jQuery, Mootools and Prototype';  toSentence(['jQuery', 'Mootools', 'Prototype'], ', ', ' unt '); // => 'jQuery, Mootools unt Prototype'; ```  #### toSentenceSerial(array, [delimiter, lastDelimiter]) => string  The same as `toSentence`, but adjusts delimeters to use [Serial comma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma).  ```javascript toSentenceSerial(['jQuery', 'Mootools']); // => 'jQuery and Mootools'  toSentenceSerial(['jQuery', 'Mootools', 'Prototype']); // => 'jQuery, Mootools, and Prototype'  toSentenceSerial(['jQuery', 'Mootools', 'Prototype'], ', ', ' unt '); // => 'jQuery, Mootools, unt Prototype' ```  #### repeat(string, count, [separator]) => string  Repeats a string count times.  ```javascript repeat('foo', 3); // => 'foofoofoo'  repeat('foo', 3, 'bar'); // => 'foobarfoobarfoo' ```  #### surround(string, wrap) => string  Surround a string with another string.  ```javascript surround('foo', 'ab'); // => 'abfooab' ```  #### quote(string, quoteChar) or q(string, quoteChar) => string  Quotes a string. `quoteChar` defaults to `'`.  ```javascript quote('foo', '''); // => ''foo''; ``` #### unquote(string, quoteChar) => string  Unquotes a string. `quoteChar` defaults to `'`.  ```javascript unquote(''foo''); // => 'foo'  unquote(''foo'', '''); // => 'foo' ```   #### slugify(string) => string  Transform text into an ascii slug which can be used in safely in URLs. Replaces whitespaces, accentuated, and special characters with a dash. Limited set of non-ascii characters are transformed to similar versions in the ascii character set such as `ä` to `a`.  ```javascript slugify('Un éléphant à l\'orée du bois'); // => 'un-elephant-a-l-oree-du-bois' ```  ***Caution: this function is charset dependent***  #### naturalCmp(string1, string2) => number  Naturally sort strings like humans would do. None numbers are compared by their [ASCII values](http://www.asciitable.com/). Note: this means 'a' > 'A'. Use `.toLowerCase` if this isn't to be desired.  Just past it to `Array#sort`.  ```javascript ['foo20', 'foo5'].sort(naturalCmp); // => ['foo5', 'foo20'] ```  #### toBoolean(string) => boolean  Turn strings that can be commonly considered as booleas to real booleans. Such as 'true', 'false', '1' and '0'. This function is case insensitive.  ```javascript toBoolean('true'); // => true  toBoolean('FALSE'); // => false  toBoolean('random'); // => undefined ```  It can be customized by giving arrays of truth and falsy value matcher as parameters. Matchers can be also RegExp objects.  ```javascript toBoolean('truthy', ['truthy'], ['falsy']); // => true  toBoolean('true only at start', [/^true/]); // => true ```  #### map(string, function) => string  Creates a new string with the results of calling a provided function on every character of the given string.  ```javascript map('Hello world', function(x) {   return x; }); // => 'Hello world'  map(12345, function(x) {   return x; }); // => '12345'  map('Hello world', function(x) {   if (x === 'o') x = 'O';   return x; }); // => 'HellO wOrld' ```  ### Library functions  If you require the full library you can use chaining and aliases  #### s(string) => chain  Start a chain. Returns an immutable chain object with the string functions as methods which return a new chain object instead of the plain string value.  The chain object includes also following native Javascript string methods:    - [toUpperCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase)   - [toLowerCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase)   - [split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)   - [replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace)   - [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice)   - [substring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substring)   - [substr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr)   - [concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/concat)  #### chain.value()  Return the string value from the chain  ```javascript s('  foo  ').trim().capitalize().value(); // => 'Foo' ```  When calling a method which does not return a string the resulting value is immediately returned  ```javascript s(' foobar ').trim().startsWith('foo'); // => true ```  #### chain.tap(function) => chain  Tap into the chain with a custom function  ```javascript s('foo').tap(function(value){   return value + 'bar'; }).value(); // => 'foobar' ```   #### Aliases  ```javascript strip     = trim lstrip    = ltrim rstrip    = rtrim center    = lrpad rjust     = lpad ljust     = rpad contains  = include q         = quote toBool    = toBoolean camelcase = camelize ```  ## Maintainers ##  This library is maintained by    - Esa-Matti Suuronen – ***[@epeli](https://github.com/epeli)***   - Christoph Hermann – ***[@stoeffel](https://github.com/stoeffel)***  ## Licence ##  The MIT License  Copyright (c) 2011 Esa-Matti Suuronen esa-matti@suuronen.org  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"update-notifier@0.3.2","https://github.com/yeoman/update-notifier","BSD*","# update-notifier [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yeoman/update-notifier.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yeoman/update-notifier)  > Update notifications for your CLI app  ![](screenshot.png)  Inform users of your package of updates in a non-intrusive way.  #### Table of Contents  - [Examples](#examples) - [How](#how) - [API](#api) - [About](#about)   ## Examples  ### Simple example  ```js var updateNotifier = require('update-notifier'); var pkg = require('./package.json');  updateNotifier({pkg: pkg}).notify(); ```  ### Comprehensive example  ```js var updateNotifier = require('update-notifier'); var pkg = require('./package.json');  // Checks for available update and returns an instance var notifier = updateNotifier({pkg: pkg});  // Notify using the built-in convenience method notifier.notify();  // `notifier.update` contains some useful info about the update console.log(notifier.update); /* { 	latest: '1.0.1', 	current: '1.0.0', 	type: 'patch', // possible values: latest, major, minor, patch, prerelease, build 	name: 'pageres' } */ ```  ### Example with settings and custom message  ```js var notifier = updateNotifier({ 	pkg: pkg, 	updateCheckInterval: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 // 1 week });  console.log('Update available: ' + notifier.update.latest); ```   ## How  Whenever you initiate the update notifier and it's not within the interval threshold, it will asynchronously check with npm in the background for available updates, then persist the result. The next time the notifier is initiated the result will be loaded into the `.update` property. This prevents any impact on your package startup performance. The check process is done in a unref'ed [child process](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options). This means that if you call `process.exit`, the check will still be performed in its own process.   ## API  ### updateNotifier(options)  Checks if there is an available update. Accepts settings defined below. Returns an object with update info if there is an available update, otherwise `undefined`.  ### options  #### pkg  Type: `object`  ##### name  *Required*   Type: `string`  ##### version  *Required*   Type: `string`  #### updateCheckInterval  Type: `number`   Default: `1000 * 60 * 60 * 24` (1 day)  How often to check for updates.  #### callback(error, update)  Type: `function`    Passing a callback here will make it check for an update directly and report right away. Not recommended as you won't get the benefits explained in [`How`](#how).  `update` is equal to `notifier.update`   ### updateNotifier.notify([options])  Convenience method to display a notification message *(see screenshot)*.  Only notifies if there is an update and the process is [TTY](http://nodejs.org/api/tty.html).  #### options.defer  Type: `boolean`   Default: `true`  Defer showing the notication to after the process has exited.   ### User settings  Users of your module have the ability to opt-out of the update notifier by changing the `optOut` property to `true` in `~/.config/configstore/update-notifier-[your-module-name].yml`. The path is available in `notifier.config.path`.  Users can also opt-out by [setting the environment variable](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/set-environment-variables.md) `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` with any value.  You could also let the user opt-out on a per run basis:  ```js if (process.argv.indexOf('--no-update-notifier') === -1) { 	// run updateNotifier() } ```   ## About  The idea for this module came from the desire to apply the browser update strategy to CLI tools, where everyone is always on the latest version. We first tried automatic updating, which we discovered wasn't popular. This is the second iteration of that idea, but limited to just update notifications.  There are a bunch projects using it:  - [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) - modern workflows for modern webapps  - [Bower](http://bower.io) - a package manager for the web  - [Pageres](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres) - responsive website screenshots  - [Node GH](http://nodegh.io) - GitHub command line tool  - [Hoodie CLI](http://hood.ie) - Hoodie command line tool  - [Roots](http://roots.cx) - a toolkit for advanced front-end development  [And 100+ more...](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/update-notifier)   ## License  [BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) and copyright Google"

"validate-npm-package-name@2.2.0","https://github.com/npm/validate-npm-package-name","ISC","# validate-npm-package-name  Give me a string and I'll tell you if it's a valid npm package name.  This package exports a single synchronous function that takes a string as input and returns an object:  ## Valid Names  ```js var validate = require('validate-npm-package-name')  validate('some-package') validate('example.com') validate('under_score') validate('123numeric') validate('crazy!') validate('@npm/thingy') validate('@jane/foo.js') ```  All of the above names are valid, so you'll get this object back:  ```js {   validForNewPackages: true,   validForOldPackages: true } ```  ## Invalid Names  ```js   validate(' leading-space:and:weirdchars') ```  That was never a valid package name, so you get this:  ```js {   validForNewPackages: false,   validForOldPackages: false,   errors: [     'name cannot contain leading or trailing spaces',     'name can only contain URL-friendly characters'   ] } ```  ## Legacy Names  In the old days of npm, package names were wild. They could have capital letters in them. They could be really long. They could be the name of an existing module in node core.  If you give this function a package name that **used to be valid**, you'll see a change in the value of `validForNewPackages` property, and a warnings array will be present:  ```js validate('cRaZY-paCkAgE-with-mixed-case-and-more-than-214-characters-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------') ```  returns:  ```js {   validForNewPackages: false,   validForOldPackages: true,   warnings: [     'name can no longer contain capital letters',     'name can no longer contain more than 214 characters'   ] } ```  ## Tests  ```sh npm install npm test ```  ## License  ISC"

"websocket-driver@0.6.0","https://github.com/faye/websocket-driver-node","MIT","# websocket-driver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node)  This module provides a complete implementation of the WebSocket protocols that can be hooked up to any I/O stream. It aims to simplify things by decoupling the protocol details from the I/O layer, such that users only need to implement code to stream data in and out of it without needing to know anything about how the protocol actually works. Think of it as a complete WebSocket system with pluggable I/O.  Due to this design, you get a lot of things for free. In particular, if you hook this module up to some I/O object, it will do all of this for you:  * Select the correct server-side driver to talk to the client * Generate and send both server- and client-side handshakes * Recognize when the handshake phase completes and the WS protocol begins * Negotiate subprotocol selection based on `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` * Negotiate and use extensions via the   [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)   module * Buffer sent messages until the handshake process is finished * Deal with proxies that defer delivery of the draft-76 handshake body * Notify you when the socket is open and closed and when messages arrive * Recombine fragmented messages * Dispatch text, binary, ping, pong and close frames * Manage the socket-closing handshake process * Automatically reply to ping frames with a matching pong * Apply masking to messages sent by the client  This library was originally extracted from the [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project but now aims to provide simple WebSocket support for any Node-based project.   ## Installation  ``` $ npm install websocket-driver ```   ## Usage  This module provides protocol drivers that have the same interface on the server and on the client. A WebSocket driver is an object with two duplex streams attached; one for incoming/outgoing messages and one for managing the wire protocol over an I/O stream. The full API is described below.   ### Server-side with HTTP  A Node webserver emits a special event for 'upgrade' requests, and this is where you should handle WebSockets. You first check whether the request is a WebSocket, and if so you can create a driver and attach the request's I/O stream to it.  ```js var http = require('http'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var server = http.createServer();  server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {   if (!websocket.isWebSocket(request)) return;    var driver = websocket.http(request);    driver.io.write(body);   socket.pipe(driver.io).pipe(socket);    driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {     console.log('Got a message', message);   });    driver.start(); }); ```  Note the line `driver.io.write(body)` - you must pass the `body` buffer to the socket driver in order to make certain versions of the protocol work.   ### Server-side with TCP  You can also handle WebSocket connections in a bare TCP server, if you're not using an HTTP server and don't want to implement HTTP parsing yourself.  The driver will emit a `connect` event when a request is received, and at this point you can detect whether it's a WebSocket and handle it as such. Here's an example using the Node `net` module:  ```js var net = require('net'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var server = net.createServer(function(connection) {   var driver = websocket.server();    driver.on('connect', function() {     if (websocket.isWebSocket(driver)) {       driver.start();     } else {       // handle other HTTP requests     }   });    driver.on('close', function() { connection.end() });   connection.on('error', function() {});    connection.pipe(driver.io).pipe(connection);    driver.messages.pipe(driver.messages); });  server.listen(4180); ```  In the `connect` event, the driver gains several properties to describe the request, similar to a Node request object, such as `method`, `url` and `headers`. However you should remember it's not a real request object; you cannot write data to it, it only tells you what request data we parsed from the input.  If the request has a body, it will be in the `driver.body` buffer, but only as much of the body as has been piped into the driver when the `connect` event fires.   ### Client-side  Similarly, to implement a WebSocket client you just need to make a driver by passing in a URL. After this you use the driver API as described below to process incoming data and send outgoing data.   ```js var net = require('net'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var driver = websocket.client('ws://www.example.com/socket'),     tcp = net.connect(80, 'www.example.com');  tcp.pipe(driver.io).pipe(tcp);  tcp.on('connect', function() {   driver.start(); });  driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {   console.log('Got a message', message); }); ```  Client drivers have two additional properties for reading the HTTP data that was sent back by the server:  * `driver.statusCode` - the integer value of the HTTP status code * `driver.headers` - an object containing the response headers   ### HTTP Proxies  The client driver supports connections via HTTP proxies using the `CONNECT` method. Instead of sending the WebSocket handshake immediately, it will send a `CONNECT` request, wait for a `200` response, and then proceed as normal.  To use this feature, call `driver.proxy(url)` where `url` is the origin of the proxy, including a username and password if required. This produces a duplex stream that you should pipe in and out of your TCP connection to the proxy server. When the proxy emits `connect`, you can then pipe `driver.io` to your TCP stream and call `driver.start()`.  ```js var net = require('net'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var driver = websocket.client('ws://www.example.com/socket'),     proxy  = driver.proxy('http://username:password@proxy.example.com'),     tcp    = net.connect(80, 'proxy.example.com');  tcp.pipe(proxy).pipe(tcp, {end: false});  tcp.on('connect', function() {   proxy.start(); });  proxy.on('connect', function() {   driver.io.pipe(tcp).pipe(driver.io);   driver.start(); });  driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {   console.log('Got a message', message); }); ```  The proxy's `connect` event is also where you should perform a TLS handshake on your TCP stream, if you are connecting to a `wss:` endpoint.  In the event that proxy connection fails, `proxy` will emit an `error`. You can inspect the proxy's response via `proxy.statusCode` and `proxy.headers`.  ```js proxy.on('error', function(error) {   console.error(error.message);   console.log(proxy.statusCode);   console.log(proxy.headers); }); ```  Before calling `proxy.start()` you can set custom headers using `proxy.setHeader()`:  ```js proxy.setHeader('User-Agent', 'node'); proxy.start(); ```   ### Driver API  Drivers are created using one of the following methods:  ```js driver = websocket.http(request, options) driver = websocket.server(options) driver = websocket.client(url, options) ```  The `http` method returns a driver chosen using the headers from a Node HTTP request object. The `server` method returns a driver that will parse an HTTP request and then decide which driver to use for it using the `http` method. The `client` method always returns a driver for the RFC version of the protocol with masking enabled on outgoing frames.  The `options` argument is optional, and is an object. It may contain the following fields:  * `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.   The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB. * `protocols` - an array of strings representing acceptable subprotocols for use   over the socket. The driver will negotiate one of these to use via the   `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header if supported by the other peer.  A driver has two duplex streams attached to it:  * <b>`driver.io`</b> - this stream should be attached to an I/O socket like a   TCP stream. Pipe incoming TCP chunks to this stream for them to be parsed, and   pipe this stream back into TCP to send outgoing frames. * <b>`driver.messages`</b> - this stream emits messages received over the   WebSocket.  Writing to it sends messages to the other peer by emitting frames   via the `driver.io` stream.  All drivers respond to the following API methods, but some of them are no-ops depending on whether the client supports the behaviour.  Note that most of these methods are commands: if they produce data that should be sent over the socket, they will give this to you by emitting `data` events on the `driver.io` stream.  #### `driver.on('open', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when the socket becomes open.  #### `driver.on('message', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when a message is received. `event` will have a `data` attribute containing either a string in the case of a text message or a `Buffer` in the case of a binary message.  You can also listen for messages using the `driver.messages.on('data')` event, which emits strings for text messages and buffers for binary messages.  #### `driver.on('error', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when a protocol error occurs due to the other peer sending an invalid byte sequence. `event` will have a `message` attribute describing the error.  #### `driver.on('close', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when the socket becomes closed. The `event` object has `code` and `reason` attributes.  #### `driver.addExtension(extension)`  Registers a protocol extension whose operation will be negotiated via the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. `extension` is any extension compatible with the [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node) framework.  #### `driver.setHeader(name, value)`  Sets a custom header to be sent as part of the handshake response, either from the server or from the client. Must be called before `start()`, since this is when the headers are serialized and sent.  #### `driver.start()`  Initiates the protocol by sending the handshake - either the response for a server-side driver or the request for a client-side one. This should be the first method you invoke.  Returns `true` if and only if a handshake was sent.  #### `driver.parse(string)`  Takes a string and parses it, potentially resulting in message events being emitted (see `on('message')` above) or in data being sent to `driver.io`.  You should send all data you receive via I/O to this method by piping a stream into `driver.io`.  #### `driver.text(string)`  Sends a text message over the socket. If the socket handshake is not yet complete, the message will be queued until it is. Returns `true` if the message was sent or queued, and `false` if the socket can no longer send messages.  This method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(string)`.  #### `driver.binary(buffer)`  Takes a `Buffer` and sends it as a binary message. Will queue and return `true` or `false` the same way as the `text` method. It will also return `false` if the driver does not support binary messages.  This method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(buffer)`.  #### `driver.ping(string = '', function() {})`  Sends a ping frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` and the callback are both optional. If a callback is given, it will be invoked when the socket receives a pong frame whose content matches `string`. Returns `false` if frames can no longer be sent, or if the driver does not support ping/pong.  #### `driver.pong(string = '')`  Sends a pong frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` is optional. Returns `false` if frames can no longer be sent, or if the driver does not support ping/pong.  You don't need to call this when a ping frame is received; pings are replied to automatically by the driver. This method is for sending unsolicited pongs.  #### `driver.close()`  Initiates the closing handshake if the socket is still open. For drivers with no closing handshake, this will result in the immediate execution of the `on('close')` driver. For drivers with a closing handshake, this sends a closing frame and `emit('close')` will execute when a response is received or a protocol error occurs.  #### `driver.version`  Returns the WebSocket version in use as a string. Will either be `hixie-75`, `hixie-76` or `hybi-$version`.  #### `driver.protocol`  Returns a string containing the selected subprotocol, if any was agreed upon using the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` mechanism. This value becomes available after `emit('open')` has fired.   ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"websocket-extensions@0.1.1","https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node","MIT","# websocket-extensions [![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-extensions-node.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-extensions-node)  A minimal framework that supports the implementation of WebSocket extensions in a way that's decoupled from the main protocol. This library aims to allow a WebSocket extension to be written and used with any protocol library, by defining abstract representations of frames and messages that allow modules to co-operate.  `websocket-extensions` provides a container for registering extension plugins, and provides all the functions required to negotiate which extensions to use during a session via the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. By implementing the APIs defined in this document, an extension may be used by any WebSocket library based on this framework.  ## Installation  ``` $ npm install websocket-extensions ```  ## Usage  There are two main audiences for this library: authors implementing the WebSocket protocol, and authors implementing extensions. End users of a WebSocket library or an extension should be able to use any extension by passing it as an argument to their chosen protocol library, without needing to know how either of them work, or how the `websocket-extensions` framework operates.  The library is designed with the aim that any protocol implementation and any extension can be used together, so long as they support the same abstract representation of frames and messages.  ### Data types  The APIs provided by the framework rely on two data types; extensions will expect to be given data and to be able to return data in these formats:  #### *Frame*  *Frame* is a structure representing a single WebSocket frame of any type. Frames are simple objects that must have at least the following properties, which represent the data encoded in the frame:  | property     | description                                                        | | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | | `final`      | `true` if the `FIN` bit is set, `false` otherwise                  | | `rsv1`       | `true` if the `RSV1` bit is set, `false` otherwise                 | | `rsv2`       | `true` if the `RSV2` bit is set, `false` otherwise                 | | `rsv3`       | `true` if the `RSV3` bit is set, `false` otherwise                 | | `opcode`     | the numeric opcode (`0`, `1`, `2`, `8`, `9`, or `10`) of the frame | | `masked`     | `true` if the `MASK` bit is set, `false` otherwise                 | | `maskingKey` | a 4-byte `Buffer` if `masked` is `true`, otherwise `null`          | | `payload`    | a `Buffer` containing the (unmasked) application data              |  #### *Message*  A *Message* represents a complete application message, which can be formed from text, binary and continuation frames. It has the following properties:  | property | description                                                       | | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | | `rsv1`   | `true` if the first frame of the message has the `RSV1` bit set   | | `rsv2`   | `true` if the first frame of the message has the `RSV2` bit set   | | `rsv3`   | `true` if the first frame of the message has the `RSV3` bit set   | | `opcode` | the numeric opcode (`1` or `2`) of the first frame of the message | | `data`   | the concatenation of all the frame payloads in the message        |  ### For driver authors  A driver author is someone implementing the WebSocket protocol proper, and who wishes end users to be able to use WebSocket extensions with their library.  At the start of a WebSocket session, on both the client and the server side, they should begin by creating an extension container and adding whichever extensions they want to use.  ```js var Extensions = require('websocket-extensions'),     deflate    = require('permessage-deflate');  var exts = new Extensions(); exts.add(deflate); ```  In the following examples, `exts` refers to this `Extensions` instance.  #### Client sessions  Clients will use the methods `generateOffer()` and `activate(header)`.  As part of the handshake process, the client must send a `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header to advertise that it supports the registered extensions. This header should be generated using:  ```js request.headers['sec-websocket-extensions'] = exts.generateOffer(); ```  This returns a string, for example `'permessage-deflate; client_max_window_bits'`, that represents all the extensions the client is offering to use, and their parameters. This string may contain multiple offers for the same extension.  When the client receives the handshake response from the server, it should pass the incoming `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header in to `exts` to activate the extensions the server has accepted:  ```js exts.activate(response.headers['sec-websocket-extensions']); ```  If the server has sent any extension responses that the client does not recognize, or are in conflict with one another for use of RSV bits, or that use invalid parameters for the named extensions, then `exts.activate()` will `throw`. In this event, the client driver should fail the connection with closing code `1010`.  #### Server sessions  Servers will use the method `generateResponse(header)`.  A server session needs to generate a `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header to send in its handshake response:  ```js var clientOffer = request.headers['sec-websocket-extensions'],     extResponse = exts.generateResponse(clientOffer);  response.headers['sec-websocket-extensions'] = extResponse; ```  Calling `exts.generateResponse(header)` activates those extensions the client has asked to use, if they are registered, asks each extension for a set of response parameters, and returns a string containing the response parameters for all accepted extensions.  #### In both directions  Both clients and servers will use the methods `validFrameRsv(frame)`, `processIncomingMessage(message)` and `processOutgoingMessage(message)`.  The WebSocket protocol requires that frames do not have any of the `RSV` bits set unless there is an extension in use that allows otherwise. When processing an incoming frame, sessions should pass a *Frame* object to:  ```js exts.validFrameRsv(frame) ```  If this method returns `false`, the session should fail the WebSocket connection with closing code `1002`.  To pass incoming messages through the extension stack, a session should construct a *Message* object according to the above datatype definitions, and call:  ```js exts.processIncomingMessage(message, function(error, msg) {   // hand the message off to the application }); ```  If any extensions fail to process the message, then the callback will yield an error and the session should fail the WebSocket connection with closing code `1010`. If `error` is `null`, then `msg` should be passed on to the application.  To pass outgoing messages through the extension stack, a session should construct a *Message* as before, and call:  ```js exts.processOutgoingMessage(message, function(error, msg) {   // write message to the transport }); ```  If any extensions fail to process the message, then the callback will yield an error and the session should fail the WebSocket connection with closing code `1010`. If `error` is `null`, then `message` should be converted into frames (with the message's `rsv1`, `rsv2`, `rsv3` and `opcode` set on the first frame) and written to the transport.  At the end of the WebSocket session (either when the protocol is explicitly ended or the transport connection disconnects), the driver should call:  ```js exts.close(function() {}) ```  The callback is invoked when all extensions have finished processing any messages in the pipeline and it's safe to close the socket.  ### For extension authors  An extension author is someone implementing an extension that transforms WebSocket messages passing between the client and server. They would like to implement their extension once and have it work with any protocol library.  Extension authors will not install `websocket-extensions` or call it directly. Instead, they should implement the following API to allow their extension to plug into the `websocket-extensions` framework.  An `Extension` is any object that has the following properties:  | property | description                                                                  | | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | `name`   | a string containing the name of the extension as used in negotiation headers | | `type`   | a string, must be `'permessage'`                                             | | `rsv1`   | either `true` if the extension uses the RSV1 bit, `false` otherwise          | | `rsv2`   | either `true` if the extension uses the RSV2 bit, `false` otherwise          | | `rsv3`   | either `true` if the extension uses the RSV3 bit, `false` otherwise          |  It must also implement the following methods:  ```js ext.createClientSession() ```  This returns a *ClientSession*, whose interface is defined below.  ```js ext.createServerSession(offers) ```  This takes an array of offer params and returns a *ServerSession*, whose interface is defined below. For example, if the client handshake contains the offer header:  ``` Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate; server_no_context_takeover; server_max_window_bits=8, \                           permessage-deflate; server_max_window_bits=15 ```  then the `permessage-deflate` extension will receive the call:  ```js ext.createServerSession([   {server_no_context_takeover: true, server_max_window_bits: 8},   {server_max_window_bits: 15} ]); ```  The extension must decide which set of parameters it wants to accept, if any, and return a *ServerSession* if it wants to accept the parameters and `null` otherwise.  #### *ClientSession*  A *ClientSession* is the type returned by `ext.createClientSession()`. It must implement the following methods, as well as the *Session* API listed below.  ```js clientSession.generateOffer() // e.g.  -> [ //            {server_no_context_takeover: true, server_max_window_bits: 8}, //            {server_max_window_bits: 15} //          ] ```  This must return a set of parameters to include in the client's `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` offer header. If the session wants to offer multiple configurations, it can return an array of sets of parameters as shown above.  ```js clientSession.activate(params) // -> true ```  This must take a single set of parameters from the server's handshake response and use them to configure the client session. If the client accepts the given parameters, then this method must return `true`. If it returns any other value, the framework will interpret this as the client rejecting the response, and will `throw`.  #### *ServerSession*  A *ServerSession* is the type returned by `ext.createServerSession(offers)`. It must implement the following methods, as well as the *Session* API listed below.  ```js serverSession.generateResponse() // e.g.  -> {server_max_window_bits: 8} ```  This returns the set of parameters the server session wants to send in its `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` response header. Only one set of parameters is returned to the client per extension. Server sessions that would confict on their use of RSV bits are not activated.  #### *Session*  The *Session* API must be implemented by both client and server sessions. It contains two methods, `processIncomingMessage(message)` and `processOutgoingMessage(message)`.  ```js session.processIncomingMessage(message, function(error, msg) { ... }) ```  The session must implement this method to take an incoming *Message* as defined above, transform it in any way it needs, then return it via the callback. If there is an error processing the message, this method should yield an error as the first argument.  ```js session.processOutgoingMessage(message, function(error, msg) { ... }) ```  The session must implement this method to take an outgoing *Message* as defined above, transform it in any way it needs, then return it via the callback. If there is an error processing the message, this method should yield an error as the first argument.  Note that both `processIncomingMessage()` and `processOutgoingMessage()` can perform their logic asynchronously, are allowed to process multiple messages concurrently, and are not required to complete working on messages in the same order the messages arrive. `websocket-extensions` will reorder messages as your extension emits them and will make sure every extension is given messages in the order they arrive from the driver. This allows extensions to maintain state that depends on the messages' wire order, for example keeping a DEFLATE compression context between messages.  ```js session.close() ```  The framework will call this method when the WebSocket session ends, allowing the session to release any resources it's using.  ## Examples  * Consumer: [websocket-driver](https://github.com/faye/websocket-driver-node) * Provider: [permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node)  ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2014-2015 James Coglan  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"ws@1.1.5","https://github.com/websockets/ws","MIT","# ws: a node.js websocket library  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/ws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/ws)  `ws` is a simple to use WebSocket implementation, up-to-date against RFC-6455, and [probably the fastest WebSocket library for node.js][archive].  Passes the quite extensive Autobahn test suite. See http://websockets.github.com/ws for the full reports.  ## Protocol support  * **Hixie draft 76** (Old and deprecated, but still in use by Safari and Opera.   Added to ws version 0.4.2, but server only. Can be disabled by setting the   `disableHixie` option to true.) * **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`) * **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option `protocolVersion: 13`)  ### Installing  ``` npm install --save ws ```  ### Opt-in for performance  There are 2 optional modules that can be installed along side with the `ws` module. These modules are binary addons which improve certain operations, but as they are binary addons they require compilation which can fail if no c++ compiler is installed on the host system.  - `npm install --save bufferutil`: Improves internal buffer operations which   allows for faster processing of masked WebSocket frames and general buffer   operations. - `npm install --save utf-8-validate`: The specification requires validation of   invalid UTF-8 chars, some of these validations could not be done in JavaScript   hence the need for a binary addon. In most cases you will already be   validating the input that you receive for security purposes leading to double   validation. But if you want to be 100% spec-conforming and have fast   validation of UTF-8 then this module is a must.  ### Sending and receiving text data  ```js var WebSocket = require('ws'); var ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');  ws.on('open', function open() {   ws.send('something'); });  ws.on('message', function(data, flags) {   // flags.binary will be set if a binary data is received.   // flags.masked will be set if the data was masked. }); ```  ### Sending binary data  ```js var WebSocket = require('ws'); var ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');  ws.on('open', function open() {   var array = new Float32Array(5);    for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {     array[i] = i / 2;   }    ws.send(array, { binary: true, mask: true }); }); ```  Setting `mask`, as done for the send options above, will cause the data to be masked according to the WebSocket protocol. The same option applies for text data.  ### Server example  ```js var WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server   , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });  wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {   ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {     console.log('received: %s', message);   });    ws.send('something'); }); ```  ### ExpressJS example  ```js var server = require('http').createServer()   , url = require('url')   , WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server   , wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: server })   , express = require('express')   , app = express()   , port = 4080;  app.use(function (req, res) {   res.send({ msg: 'hello' }); });  wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {   var location = url.parse(ws.upgradeReq.url, true);   // you might use location.query.access_token to authenticate or share sessions   // or ws.upgradeReq.headers.cookie (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/16395220/151312)    ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {     console.log('received: %s', message);   });    ws.send('something'); });  server.on('request', app); server.listen(port, function () { console.log('Listening on ' + server.address().port) }); ```  ### Server sending broadcast data  ```js var WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server   , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });  wss.broadcast = function broadcast(data) {   wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {     client.send(data);   }); }; ```  ### Error handling best practices  ```js // If the WebSocket is closed before the following send is attempted ws.send('something');  // Errors (both immediate and async write errors) can be detected in an optional // callback. The callback is also the only way of being notified that data has // actually been sent. ws.send('something', function ack(error) {   // if error is not defined, the send has been completed,   // otherwise the error object will indicate what failed. });  // Immediate errors can also be handled with try/catch-blocks, but **note** that // since sends are inherently asynchronous, socket write failures will *not* be // captured when this technique is used. try { ws.send('something'); } catch (e) { /* handle error */ } ```  ### echo.websocket.org demo  ```js var WebSocket = require('ws'); var ws = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org/', {   protocolVersion: 8,   origin: 'http://websocket.org' });  ws.on('open', function open() {   console.log('connected');   ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true}); });  ws.on('close', function close() {   console.log('disconnected'); });  ws.on('message', function message(data, flags) {   console.log('Roundtrip time: ' + (Date.now() - parseInt(data)) + 'ms', flags);    setTimeout(function timeout() {     ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});   }, 500); }); ```  ### Other examples  For a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the examples folder.  Note that the usage together with Express 3.0 is quite different from Express 2.x. The difference is expressed in the two different serverstats-examples.  Otherwise, see the test cases.  ### Running the tests  ``` make test ```  ## API Docs  See [`/doc/ws.md`](https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/master/doc/ws.md) for Node.js-like docs for the ws classes.  ## Changelog  We're using the GitHub [`releases`](https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases) for changelog entries.  ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2011 Einar Otto Stangvik &lt;einaros@gmail.com&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
